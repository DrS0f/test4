{"prompt":"How does the SM7B compare to the vintage SM5B?","completion":"Both are cardioid dynamic microphones intended for broadcast voice applications.Both are transformerless.The SM7B and SM5B moving-coil cartridges were similar, but not identical.The SM7B incorporates a humbucking coil.The SM7B incorporates the internal volume of the microphone body as part of the acoustic design of the cartridge; the SM5B did not.Historical Note: Among some audio engineers in the broadcast radio market, the SM5B has the reputation of being the finest voice-over microphone ever made. However, the SM5B was not a successful product for Shure.  It was expensive and difficult to manufacture.  The best sales year in its history saw a quantity sold of only 200 units.  With such a low sales volume, the SM5B parts suppliers kept increasing their prices.  Eventually, it was not economically feasible to keep the SM5B in the Shure product line.  The SM7, introduced in 1972, has been and continues to be a very successful product worldwide.  It has outsold the SM5B by many magnitudes."}
{"prompt":"What is an overview of the KSM8 and how does its performance compare to the Unidyne III (SM58, SM57, 565, 545.)","completion":"The KSM8 Dualdyne microphone is an evolutionary change in dynamic microphone design - a new electro-acoustic tool that solves unique technical issues of high-end sound reinforcement systems and operation.  Compared to the Unidyne III, the KSM8 offers:Minimized proximity effect - provides a bigger sweet spot and increased working distanceNeutral frequency response - requires minimal equalization/signal processingImproved uniformity of the cardioid pattern - produces uncolored/natural off-axis responseDent resistant grilleReduced audible popping from plosivesImproved moisture resistanceIncreased output level - from redesigned magnetic structurePumping pneumatic shock mount - reduces handling noiseLet's examine each KSM8 advancement:Minimized Proximity Effect / Greater Working Distance: As a singer gets closer to a unidirectional microphone, bass frequencies intensify at a faster rate than the higher frequencies. This bass increase is called proximity effect because it occurs when the singer is very near, or proximate, to the mic. Proximity effect can add warmth to the singer's sound, but it can also cause muddiness by degrading the intelligibility of the singer's voice. Proximity effect is a side effect of making a microphone unidirectional.Because of proximity effect, a singer must learn the sweet spot of a microphone. The sweet spot is the mouth-to-mic distance where the bass increase from proximity effect is \"just right,\" not so much as to sound muddy, and not too little as to sound thin. Many unidirectional microphones have a restricted sweet spot and this limits how the singer works the mic. Working a mic is the movement of the microphone toward the mouth or away from the mouth so as to modulate the intensity of the singer's projected voice.Singing artists and sound engineers often desire a microphone with an increased working distance, that is, a microphone that can be used at varying distances from the mouth without distracting changes in the tonal balance. The KSM8 provides this desirable increase in working distance by minimizing proximity effect. The precise Dualdyne mechanics of how proximity effect is minimized is complex and beyond the scope of this document. In simple terms, the rear diaphragm is acoustically transparent to upper frequencies but blocks lower frequencies from reaching the backside of the front diaphragm. This deceives the front diaphragm into acting like an omnidirectional element - which has no proximity effect. However, this rear diaphragm subterfuge does not affect the actual cardioid polar pattern of the mic. So the KSM8 provides the gain-before-feedback performance of a cardioid mic while suppressing proximity effect like an omnidirectional microphone. Neat trick, eh?  Neutral Frequency Response: The presence peak in the Unidyne III is a high frequency boost in the range of 3 kHz to 8 kHz. This adds a brightness to the sound quality that many find pleasing. But there is another reason for this presence peak; it tends to offset the substantial bass boost from proximity effect found in the Unidyne III. Since the KSM8 has less proximity effect, a significant presence peak is not required. This will appeal to artists and sound engineers who prefer a sound that is more neutral… less bright. The minimized presence peak provides a perceived increase in bass response when the artist is farther away from the KSM8 and also reduces acoustic feedback issues in the 3 kHz to 8 kHz frequency band.  Uniform Cardioid Polar Pattern: The KSM8 has a more consistent [uniform] cardioid polar pattern than the Unidyne III. The heart shape pattern of the KSM8 remains nearly the same at 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2.5 kHz, and 9 kHz.  Only at 6.5 kHz does the pattern transform to a shape similar to a supercardioid. This uniformity of the KSM8 cardioid pattern offers better gain-before-feedback when used for sound reinforcement. It also improves the vocal clarity heard in stage monitors and in-ear monitors.Dent Resistant Grille: The KSM8 grille is fabricated from hardened carbon steel. Hardening carbon steel causes the molecular structure to crystallize, similar to the way coal changes to diamond under the heat and pressure within the earth. The KSM8 grille is virtually immune to the rough handling and physical abuse which occur daily in a professional setting.Reduced Plosives: Commonly called P-popping, a plosive is a blast of air when certain letters are pronounced; P, B, and T are the worst culprits. Try it yourself. With fingers point upward, place your palm three inches in front of your mouth, and say: \"Bob. Peter. Tom.\" Feel the blast of air? That is a plosive. When a plosive combines with the proximity effect of a unidirectional microphone, the result is an ugly audible \"pop.\"  As the KSM8 has substantially less proximity effect, the end result is reduced P-popping. The improvement is a 6 dB reduction (at 100 Hz) compared to the Unidyne III.Improved Moisture Resistance: The KSM8 grill is lined with water-resistant, hydrophobic fabric that also reduces wind noise and plosives. In addition, the passive rear diaphragm prevents water from reaching the internal acoustic chambers.  Though the KSM8 is not water-proof, it is extremely resistant to damage from condensation, precipitation, and other forms of invasive moisture.Increased Output Level: The KSM8 has a new magnetic circuit design. Compared to the Unidyne III, the KSM8 Dualdyne output signal is 3 dB greater, providing an improved signal-to-noise ratio.Pneumatic Shock Mount: The shock mount concept from the Unidyne III has been improved to keep handling noise to a minimum. The KSM8 diaphragm remains nearly motionless no matter the direction of the physical vibration - up, down, left, or right.Note well that the KSM8 is not a replacement for the SM58 or the Beta 58A. The KSM8 is a new microphone choice for high-end touring sound reinforcement professionals. So, where might the KSM8 not be the best choice?A venue where the monitor engineer requires maximum stage volume from floor monitors. The Beta 58A or KSM9HS (set to hyper-cardioid) may be more appropriate because of the tighter polar pattern.A venue that hosts artists with inadvisable mic technique, like cupping the grille of the mic. The KSM9HS (set to hyper-cardioid) may be more appropriate as it is tolerates a wide variety of microphone techniques.  A small/medium sized venue where gain-before-feedback is a challenge. Or a venue that hosts new artists every night and requires the most versatile model of microphone. Such a venue may be better off with the SM58 or Beta 58A.An artist or sound engineer who prefers the sound quality of the SM58 or Beta 58A. It is not unusual for artists to have honed their signature sound with a specific model; thus there is no motivation/need for a microphone change.In 1959, the Unidyne III brought revolutionary features to the sound reinforcement market. In 2016, the innovative KSM8 does the same with its leading-edge advancements. When employed to solve the specific issues of high-end touring sound, the KSM8 provides outstanding performance.For additional information, please refer to the Dualdyne White Paper (pdf)."}

The preamp will be a four inch long tube with a male XLR output; or it will be a plastic box which can contain a 9 volt battery and has a male XLR output on the end of an attached cable. If you do not have one of these preamps, the MX391 will not operate. In order of connection, you must have: the MX391 mics -> cable connecting MX391 to preamp -> cable connecting preamp to mixer.If you do have a preamp, make certain the phantom power on the mixer is 11 to 52 volts. Make certain the phantom is turned on.Make certain the MX391 preamp is connected to an XLR input on the mixer.Connecting the MX391 directly to your camera will not work unless you have the preamp which can hold a 9 volt battery AND your camera has a mic input with electrical specifications that will match the MX391.Go to: Audio Systems Guide for Video ProductionRead this book to educate yourself on using mics for video production.How to test phantom power voltage and current"}
{"prompt":"Moisture is clearly bad for condenser mics, but I'm curious as to what extent and how it effects the mic. If my condenser has suffered some moisture damage, will it be obvious, like pops, crackles, or other clear electrical problems, or might it be a more subtle degradation of the sound that might not be noticed right away? I want to know since I periodically take my large diaphragm studio condenser to other locations, and when the weather is cold, when the case is opened back inside, even after some time to acclimate, a small amount of condensation forms on the case, though not visibly anywhere else. Can this type of moisture damage the mic, and if so, how would I know?","completion":"Typically, light condensation like you describe will not be a problem. Moisture could cause a problem is if it is on the diaphragm. If moisture is on the diaphragm, the sound will likely be very poor. It would not be a subtle degradation.Letting the microphone air dry will typically allow the it to recover. Shure puts all of our condenser microphones through extensive environmental testing. If it is a Shure microphone, the type of moisture that you describe shouldn't be a problem."}

Also, is output voltage determined from the cartridge only or can it vary according to the stylus (i.e., for cartridges that will accept more than one stylus)? ","completion":"The output voltage of the M104E is 5.0 millivolts at 1,000 Hz at 5 cm/sec peak velocity.The output voltage is determined by two factors: 1) The field strength of the magnet at the end of the stylus shank; 2) The number of coil windings in the cartridge body."}

{"prompt":"I have a camcorder (Canon XL-1) with XLR inputs for left and right channels. Most mics I own seem to be mono or one channel. If I want the input from the mic to be recorded in stereo, what do I need to do? Get a \"Y\" stereo splitter? What if I had a 4 mic mixer? Could I have 4 sound sources and record them all in stereo (2 channels) with the same technique or solution? I don't want the audio on my video tape to be mono.","completion":"To be precise, one mic signal going to both channels on your recorder is not \"stereo\". It is simply mono recorded on two tracks. Stereo implies two different but related audio signals.We will assume that the Canon XL-1 is not supplying phantom power or bias to the mics. In that case, a simple Y adapter will work. Go to: Markertek to find XLR to XLR Y adapters.When using a four input mono mixer, like the Shure SCM268, the Y adapter can be used to feed the Canon Left and Right inputs."}
{"prompt":"I want to use a wireless mic at a racetrack to interview drives in the pit area.  I need a wireless mic that can transmit 1,000 feet or more, and transmit through metal fencing. What do you recommend?","completion":"A wireless mic will not work for this application because of the: 1) low output power that is regulated Federal Law; 2) The absorption of the RF signal by the human bodies in the pit; 3) The reflection of the RF signals by the metal objects and fencing.Certain external TV antennas can be connected to Shure receivers to increase the range, but that is not the solution.The proper way to do this is by using a wireless mic to transmit a short distance (under 50 feet) to a microwave link transmitter located in the pits. The microwave transmitter covers the long distance to the press box. This is how FOX, ABC, and others do pit interviews."}

{"prompt":"I've been using my BG4.1 with batteries as an unbalanced mic (XLR to 1/4\" mono cable). I have a new mixer that accepts XLR balanced mics and also has 48 volt phantom supply. How do I use this mic in this configuration: (1) Do I remove the internal battery to utilize the phantom supply? (2) If I don't use the phantom supply and continue to use battery instead, does the mic still produce a balanced signal? (3) I've seen mic cables advertised that are 2 conductor but have XLR on both ends - how do these carry balanced signals (I thought you needed 3 conductors). How do I identify proper cables? Thanks.","completion":"The BG4.1 always has a balanced output, regardless of power source. It is the cable that unbalances the signal. Anytime the BG4.1 receives phantom power, it will use it instead of the battery. You do not need to remove the battery when using phantom. Nor does the battery need to be installed when phantom power is present.Phantom power does require 3 conductors. If a cable is labeled as 2 conductor, shielded, that actually means it has 3 conductors. Any properly designed XLR to XLR cable will have 3 conductors: two twisted inner conductors surrounded by a shield. "}

{"prompt":"How can I mount the SM7B and MV7 microphones? Are there special stands available?","completion":"The SM7B and MV7 can be mounted in a wide variety of configurations. The SM7B contains internal shock mounting, so external shock mounts are not required. However, higher-end boom arms do minimize the amount of desk noise transmitted to the mic.Traditionally, the SM7B and MV7 are mounted to a boom arm so that the mic can be positioned in front of a person sitting in a radio or podcast studio. There are a number of good options for boom arms out there, such as:GatorKönig & Meyer (MV7 available with K&M boom arms as a bundle)O.C. WhiteYellowtec M!ka Boom ArmsThe SM7B and MV7 can also be mounted to a traditional floor or desktop mic stand. Some manufacturers include:GatorKönig & Meyer On-Stage StandsUltimateWhirlwindThe SM7B and MV7 come configured to mount on a 5/8\"-27 microphone stand thread. There is an adaptor included to connect to a 3/8\"-16 (European-style) mounts. Both mounts require a male end on the stand. For the SM7B to fasten tightly to a mic stand, there must be 7 mm (3/8\") of external (male) thread exposed on the mic stand. If there is a retaining ring on the mic stand thread, remove it and this will typically expose about 10 mm of male thread. Note that the XLR connector on the SM7B is close to the threaded mic mount, so verify that the cable will still attach with your choice of mic mount.The MV7 is also available in three bundles which include a desktop tripod stand:MV7 SRH440A Tripod BundleMV7 Kit + SE215 Pro EarphonesMV7 Kit + Wireless Headphone BundleIf you are interested in purchasing the Manfrotto Tripod separately, please see this article: I need a desktop tripod for my MV7"}

{"prompt":"Can I connect to a soundboard at a concert hall via XLR jacks or 1/4 inch phone plugs (which ever they may have),using 2 A15AS switchable line attenuators connecting one Y cable with 2 female XLR connectors leading to one stereo mini-plug which would plug into my Panasonic AG-456UP camcorder's mic input jack? Will they attenuate the signal down by 50db if I switch both attenuators to 25db?","completion":"To attenuate a line level output to match a mic level input, use the A15LA; it is a 50 dB pad. Assuming you are recording a stereo signal, you will require two A15LA pads, one for the left output and one for the right output.Placing two A15AS in series will provide nearly 50 dB of attenuation, but the actual attenuation amount depends upon the output impedance of the mixing board, and the input impedance of your camera.Also, check out products by Beachtek. They may have a pre-made solution."}
{"prompt":"I have two of the KSM32 mics, the champagne with the shockmount & case, etc. Now I'm intrigued by the new KSM27.

Will the 27 mic fit on that Shurelock swivelmount that I also have? 3. Will the 32 mic fit in the 27 mount?","completion":"1. No. The KSM27 body is larger then the saddle used in the shock mount for the KSM32.2. Yes.3. The KSM32 will thread into the shockmount for the KSM27, but the saddle in the shockmount will be too large and the KSM32 will be loose in the shockmount."}
{"prompt":"I have recently been looking to purchase some UHF wireless mics, and it has come down to a contest between you and Sennheiser. I like everything about the Shure UHF series and have used them before, but the transmitters only transmit at 10 mW. Whereas, the Sennheiser UHF transmitters transmit at 50 mW on the same frequency spectrum. Could you please tell me why your highest quality mic system has such a low power output?","completion":"Longer battery life than transmitters with higher outputs.Allows more simultaneous operating systems due to less IM problems.Can be sold in Japan which regulates wireless mics to a max 10mW output.Allows Shure UHF to meet German specifications for spurious RF emissions.In UHF bands, there is much less RF interference and the interference that is there has much lower power. Therefore, 10 mW is typically plenty of power.When tested against higher output competitors, we equal or exceed their transmission range - due to our very efficient antenna design and very efficient receiver design.Also, realize that the specification that we must state according to FCC regulation, is the conductive output power. Conductive output power does not take into effect antenna efficiency.The UC system uses 50 mW transmitters, because the antenna efficiency is not as good as the UHF series.We suggest that you test the units yourself to see which one has a better range."}
{"prompt":"I have a Shure wireless microphone. How can I find out what television station matches up with the frequency that I am trying to use?","completion":"Many wireless microphones use the same frequencies as television stations.

I do not want the speaker on one channel--i.e., coming out of just one speaker, while the audience comes from another. They need to be mixed. Will a simple 'Y' connecter, merging both signals into one suffice? The quality of the recording does not need to be CD quality and any level differences between speaker and audience can be manipulated with software. I want to record the sessions directly into a laptop computer in which already resides the editing software. This, of course, presents the problem of impedance matching as all laptops (to my knowledge) have only mike level impedance for input. Does the BLX88 have an option of line-level or preamp level output? The resultant audio file will eventually be deposited on CD. Thank you for your help.","completion":"We suggest getting a two channel computer interface to connect the two mic channels to the computer. Many are available."}
{"prompt":"During World War II, Shure manufactured a \"Battle Announce\" microphone. What was unique about it?","completion":"The Battle Announce microphone was resistant to an explosive blast and the shock wave from the blast.   The mic had to be physically rugged to withstand the vibration of the blast, but also had to operate properly after the blast. The mic element was controlled reluctance, also called controlled magnetic.  The mic diaphragm connects to a solid metal pin. The pin moves a ferrous armature that disturbs a magnetic field.  The fluxuating magnetic field produces a signal voltage in a stationary coil of wire. To make such a mic element blast-resistant, a small spring is inserted between the solid metal pin and the armature.  During normal operation, the spring is stiff enough to maintain constant contact between the pin and the armature.  When a blast occurs, the spring is compressed and absorbs the shock wave, thus avoiding damage to the armature.

{"prompt":"An old friend of the family recently passed away, and among the things he owned were two Shure \"bullet\"-type mics. I'm a harmonica player, and have been using them in concert - they sound fantastic! Can I find out their age, and when/where they were manufactured? I would guess that they are quite early models. Both mics have the Shure Bros. plates on them, and both are gray/silver model 707A's. One does NOT have a serial # (it just has the model # - there is not even a space on the Shure plate for the serial #), and the other has a serial # of 182, I believe (I do not have the mics in front of me as I write this...). Any help or information would be GREATLY appreciated - - these mics mean a great deal to me, and they also sound GREAT when you plug 'em in!","completion":"The 707A was available from 1940 to 1970. Unfortunately, we do not have the records to narrow it down any further. These microphones would have been manufactured in either Chicago or in Evanston, IL. "}
{"prompt":"Is there a splitter/adapter that will connect two Shure Beta 98 mics into one body pack transmitter input jack?","completion":"No such adapter is offered by Shure.  It is not recommended to connect two Beta 98 mics into one transmitter.    The transmitter may not supply enough bias current to satisfy both mics.  Then, the mics may distort at a lower SPL level.You may try this if you wish.  No damage will occur to the mics if they paralled together using a fabricated Y-cable."}
{"prompt":"Why can't the Beta 87A can not have a monitor speaker placed directly in front of the user?","completion":"Because the Beta 87A has a supercardioid polar pattern.

I have tried wireless systems, but we cannot afford to buy high quality systems for all our actors. Choir mics such as MX202, do not allow enough gain. Do you have any suggestions? How would the VP89 work for this application? Thank you for your help.","completion":"Shotgun microphones, such as the VP89, are not typically used for public address applications. The rear polar response of a shotgun microphone is not consistent and has many lobes that are unpredictable. A shotgun mic is not an \"audio zoom lens\".It sounds like you need a Sound Contractor or Consultant to look at your PA system and determine why it isn't providing enough gain before feedback. We are guessing that a complete system redesign may be in order. Changing microphones is probably not going to provide enough of a difference.Again, the VP89 (or any shotgun) is not recommended for your PA application. Shotgun microphones are useful for camera or recording work when the microphone has to be about 3-4 feet away from the talkers and a PA system is not involved."}

I guess my question is can a swimming pool cause a delay when it is between my handheld and the base unit? Thank you for any help, answers, ideas, or suggestions.","completion":"The delay is acoustical, not electrical.  And the pool could cause other acoustical reflections as water is an excellent reflector of sound.Sound travels at about 1 foot per millisecond. If you are 200 feet from a loudspeaker, you would hear your amplified voice delayed by 0.2 seconds - two-tenths of second and that is a noticeable acoustical delay.Indoors, the same amount of delay is often not a noticeable because of the numerous reflections off the walls and ceilings."}

{"prompt":"I want to connect the headphone output of my MP3 player or my laptop computer into a Shure bodypack transmitter that has a T4M connector. Where can I get a cable like this?","completion":"A custom 3.5mm (1/8\") TRS plug to TA4F cable is offered by T.C. Furlong Pro Audio: www.tcfurlong.com - Phone: 847-367-9588The cable is available with straight or right-angle plugs, and in custom lengths up to 6'. A stereo version for sending signal into two wireless beltpacks is also available.This custom cable allows audio to be sent from an iPhone, iPad, or other 3.5mm (1/8\") headphone jack to a Shure wireless bodypack transmitter with a TA4M connector, such as AD1, ULXD1, QLXD1, SLX1, GLXD1, BLX1 and others. The cable sums the stereo signal to mono and provides the necessary circuitry for the bodypack transmitter to receive the audio signal.T.C. Furlong employs this cable for walk-testing wireless microphone coverage as it is easier to play music through the transmitter than to continually talk through a microphone. The cable is also used with iPhone or iPad music apps for live performance without wires.Roth Sound (989-779-8828) also offers a 3.5mm to TA4F cable available at: https://www.rothsound.com/ikenny-kable-3-5mm-to-ta4f-shure-bodypack-transmitters-p-508NOTE: To avoid distortion when using this cable, it is necessary to set the headphone volume control at a very low level.

{"prompt":"I am a singer/songwriter that has become known for my 55SH Series II. The guy with the \"cool looking Mic\". I have come to love my 55 over the past couple of years. My question is this. Although the mic provides stellar sound I have found that the frequency range of the Beta 58 I have seems to be wider, offering me a \"fuller, richer\" sound. I removed the face plate on the 55 and the lid to the 58. The capsules look the same. I was wondering, is the capsule in the 55 a \"straight\" 58? And if so, could the capsule in the 55 be replaced with a Beta 58 capsule to attain the same punch? It's just a thought. Thanks for the years of GREAT sound support!!","completion":"The Shure Super 55 is exactly what you described. The Super 55 uses a modified version of the Beta 58A cartridge. If you already own a model 55SH Series II, consider the R115S upgrade kit; a do-it-yourself project. The output level of Super 55 is about 5 dB greater than the 55SH Series II, and the mic on/off switch still operates after the R115S is installed. R115S Instruction Sheet.Note that the Super 55 is designed to be mounted on a mic stand and is not meant to be a hand-held microphone.  If it is used as a hand-held mic and the singer's hand is wrapped around the rear of the microphone, the frequency response between 500 Hz and 1,000 Hz will be adversely affected.   If the mic must be held in the singer's hand, we strongly recommend using the stem of the microphone as the grasping point.Also note that the Super 55, like the 55SH Series II, does not offer the same amount of \"P-popping\" protection as a mic with a ball grille, such as the SM58.  To reduce \"P-popping\", locate the Super 55 at the corner of your mouth and not under your nose.  Sing across the mic grille and not directly into it.There is a gentleman in Illinois who will modify a 55SH Series II to put a Beta 87A cartridge in it.

This is the IP address that a device should revert to if the IP address mode is set to Dynamic, but it does not receive an IP address from a DHCP server (as would be the case if a CU is connected directly to the network jack on a PC). A firmware update to the CU will correct this problem. The latest firmware update can be found here:https://www.shure.com/en-US/support/downloads/software-firmware-archive/dds-5900-and-dcs-6000In order to perform a firmware update, the new firmware must be loaded into the CU via the embedded browser-based GUI. Connection to the CU is established by entering the IP address of the unit into your browser's address bar. Since a CU in this mode is only displaying zeros, you have two alternatives:1.     Use an Ethernet router or switch with a DHCP server to hand out an IP address to the CU 5905.2.     Change the IP Address mode of the CU to Static and manually enter an IP address for the CU.

{"prompt":"What is a direct box and what is it used for?","completion":"A direct box is used to convert an unbalanced, high impedance signal (such as an electric guitar signal) to a balanced, low impedance signal, similar to a typical microphone level signal. This low impedance signal is then sent to the PA mixer and/or recording mixer.The unbalanced, high impedance device typically uses 1/4\" phone plug connectors. The output to the mixer is typically XLR connector. A direct box will also have a loop through for the unbalanced, high impedance signal. A direct box can be passive (does not require any power source) or active (requires a power source). Also, a direct box will provide some isolation between the instrument and the mixer.A direct box is most often used for guitars or keyboards. By placing a direct box between the guitar output and the guitar amplifier, the guitar signal can be sent to both the guitar amp and the mixer, while also providing isolation between the guitar amp and the mixer.To summarize, a direct box will balance, isolate, and convert an unbalanced, high impedance signal to a balanced, low impedance signal."}

{"prompt":"I am looking for a system to record focus group sessions. Approximately 10 people around a table, in a variety of rooms. My previous recordings have picked up too much room noise, and the voices were difficult to hear. Any suggestions?","completion":"The response to your question is rather complicated. On a basic level, the closer the mic is to the sound source (the talker) the better the audio will be as it will pick up more desirable sound. Uni-directional microphones would help to pick up less background noise, but in an \"around the table\" situation, using uni-directional microphones means that you must use more than just one microphone. More microphones pick up more noise and reverberation than just one. If you use more than two or three microphones, use an automatic mixer as it turns mics on and off as people speak.Below links are to Shure applications bulletins that address this in depth. The easiest thing is to find a really quiet room and use just one omni-directional microphone in the center of the table. Our MX391BP/0 would be an appropriate table mic. Depending on what recorder you have, you might need an adapter to connect to it.Predicting speech to background noise level at the microphone"}

{"prompt":"Can I use more than one MXA910 ceiling array or MXA310 table arrays in a room? How do they connect together?","completion":"Yes. Just like any other microphone, you may install multiples to cover a room.The audio output from multiple ceiling arrays (or table arrays) can be combined with a mixer or external DSP (i.e. P300, Intellimix Room, or other Dante-enabled DSPs from third parties). Multiple arrays cannot directly share DSP resources with each other.The microphones cannot be daisy-chained together, but by installing a small network switch with PoE under the table or in a ceiling, multiple array microphones can be locally connected and then a single cable run from the switch back to a central location.Note that each microphone must be configured independently. At this time, the embedded software in the device does not allow for multiple devices to be configured from a single interface.Shure Designer software can be used allows multiple \"virtual\" MXA910 Ceiling Array Microphones to be configured in one tool. Arrange pickup lobes over a room diagram for precise coverage; import saved settings to each MXA910 on site."}

{"prompt":"What is Mutlicast and IGMP?","completion":"You might have heard that some Dante and AES67 networks rely on Multicast and IGMP to function properly. But what exactly is Multicast and IGMP, and how does it work? This FAQ is intended to give an overview of Multicast and IGMP, and how proper switch configuration can create very stable audio network. Please note that this article will not discuss IPv6 Multicast, which is not currently supported by Shure devices.What is multicast traffic?Multicast traffic is a type of IP network traffic intended for one or more destinations. Multicast is more efficient than unicast traffic because a source only needs to send data to the network once, letting the network do the hard part. It's also less bandwidth-intensive than broadcast traffic, because only the units who want the traffic will see it. Receiving devices can be on the local network or across the Internet. For Dante and AES67 networks, we are only concerned with multicast traffic which remains within the local network.Multicast uses special IPv4 destination addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255. Each address is generally referred to as a Multicast Group. Traffic intended for the multicast group has a destination address of that multicast group and a source address of the device that sent it. There are a few special groups of addresses:224.0.0.0-224.0.0.255: These are reserved for the local network which the devices are on. It won't be passed along to another subnet by a router. This range is sometimes designated as 224.0.0.0/24, and most switches will send this traffic to all devices on the local network--with a few exceptions noted later.239.0.0.0-239.255.255.255: These are reserved for use by private organizations, and won't be routed over the Internet. Organizations are free to use these addresses as they see fit.All multicast traffic is UDP/IP, and various manufacturers and organizations have standardized a wide variety of multicast protocols. The special IPv4 multicast group addresses are mapped to a special range of MAC addresses, between 01-00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF. Note that there is not a 1:1 match between multicast group addresses--because there are 28 bits of freedom in IPv4 multicast addresses but only 23 bits of freedom in IPv4 multicast MAC addresses, each IPv4 MAC address can represent up to 32 possible IPv4 multicast groups.Individual devices will decide which multicast groups they are interested in joining. In small networks, this works like broadcast traffic--all units receive all traffic, and they self-select the data they want. In larger networks, though, a more efficient solution is needed. This is provided by Internet Group Management Protocol, or IGMP.What is IGMP and IGMP Snooping?IGMP is a protocol used by network equipment to specify which devices should receive which multicast groups. Without IGMP, a network switch would forward any multicast traffic to all switchports on the switch. Devices would be responsible for filtering out the traffic that they do not want to receive. This would not work well in large network, as undesired traffic would overwhelm devices.When IGMP is configured and in use, one device on the network is designated as the IGMP Querier, and it is responsible for asking devices what multicast groups they want to join on the network. The querier then tracks those responses and passes them to the switch or switches to add to their Multicast Forwarding Database. This database is a table of multicast IPv4 or multicast MAC addresses as well the switchports which should receive that traffic. When multicast traffic arrives at the switch, the switch checks the table and then passes the traffic to all ports which should receive it. Because the Querier communicates with devices on the network, it needs to have an IP address in the same subnet as the devices wishing to receive the multicast traffic. The Querier is often running on your network switch, so the network switch must have an IP address on the local network (as opposed to the factory default address, in some cases).The Querier has a few user-configurable options. The most important is the Querier Interval, which is the rate at which the querier will ask devices to report back what groups they wish to maintain membership in. We recommend setting this as low as it can go--30 seconds is a safe number generally. The network switch or switches will talk to the Querier to determine which devices want which Multicast groups. The switches then apply filtering to incoming network traffic, sending multicast traffic only to the desired destinations. When there are multiple switches configured, all switches talk to the Querier to gather this information. The port on a switch which can see the querier is often called the mrouter port.There are two versions of IGMP commonly in use: IGMPv2 and IGMPv3. IGMPv2 deals only with the destination multicast group. In IGMPv2, a device registers its interest in receiving all traffic sent to a given multicast group, and the network hardware obliges by sending all traffic sent to that group, regardless of origin. IGMPv3 adds the concept of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), which allows a device to specify not only the group it wishes to receive traffic from, but also the desired sender(s). In addition, while IGMPv2 join requests are sent to the multicast group address desired, IGMPv3 adds IGMP-specific multicast groups to handle join and leave requests. AES67 and Dante both use IGMPv2, though an IGMPv3 querier can handle IGMPv2 requests. Shure devices only require IGMPv2.Misconfigured IGMP settings are the primary cause of Network Audio problems. Please review our Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 FAQ.Registered and Unregistered MulticastIn most cases, devices will register for the multicast groups that they want to receive by responding to the IGMP Querier's requests. Each requested group is then added to each switch's Multicast Forwarding Database along with the ports which should receive the traffic. However, sometimes multicast traffic exists on the network which is not registered at all.Certain IPv4 multicast groups receive special treatment. 224.0.0.0/24 (224.0.0.0-224.0.0.255) is one of these groups, and the IGMP standard generally requires that this traffic be broadcast to all ports on the same VLAN or switch.However, in some cases a multicast source will be sending traffic to a normal multicast group which has no registered receivers. This can happen when a device, like a video encoder, does not want to receive its own traffic back, and no devices have asked to receive the signal. Switches usually have a configuration option to either forward this traffic to all switchports or filter it. In audio-only networks, forwarding is generally advised, as this traffic is usually low bandwidth. However, filtering the traffic can cause problems, such as preventing devices from discovering one another. However, filtering is required for any networks which contain video traffic due to the amount of bandwidth video requires.Most switches have the ability to create custom forwarding rules for specific multicast groups. In general, this is usually not necessary. However, in cases where filtering of unregistered multicast traffic is required (for example, in networks with multicast video sources), you may need to manually forward specific groups. If this situation applies to you, please review the Shure Multicast Groups and Ports document for more information on required multicast groups.An Example of IGMP Snooping in ActionA technician is installing two new conference rooms at his company, and will be using two MXA910's and a third-party DSP unit in each room. To simplify installation and management of the systems, the technician has chosen to use a ten-port Cisco SG350-10P network switch, which will be shared between both rooms. The switch and DSP units are located in his IT closet, and the MXA910 mics are connected directly back to the same switch from the rooms using Cat6 cable. The MXA910's will send audio to the DSP units via AES67, which uses Multicast audio streams.The network has IP Addresses assigned as follows:RoomDeviceInternal FunctionAddressSubnet MaskSwitch PortRoom AFront MXA910Shure Control10.1.1.10255.255.255.0Gigabit 01Room A  Network Audio10.1.1.20255.255.255.0Gigabit 01Room ARear MXA910Shure Control10.1.1.11255.255.255.0Gigabit 02Room A  Network Audio10.1.1.21255.255.255.0Gigabit 02Room BFront MXA910Shure Control10.1.1.30255.255.255.0Gigabit 03Room B  Network Audio10.1.1.40255.255.255.0Gigabit 03Room BRear MXA910Shure Control10.1.1.31255.255.255.0Gigabit 04Room B  Network Audio10.1.1.41255.255.255.0Gigabit 04IT ClosetDSP ANetwork Audio10.1.1.22255.255.255.0Gigabit 05IT ClosetDSP BNetwork Audio10.1.1.42255.255.255.0Gigabit 06IT ClosetCisco SG350-10PManagement IP10.1.1.254255.255.255.0InternalIT ClosetEngineer PCComputer IP10.1.1.250255.255.255.0Gigabit 07The following Multicast groups were assigned by the Dante chipset in the MXA910 mics (note that in practice, the addresses are randomized):Room AFront MXA910239.69.20.20Room ARear MXA910239.69.21.21Room BFront MXA910239.69.40.40Room BRear MXA910239.69.41.41In addition, the MXA910 mics will need access to the following IP Multicast Groups to function:224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233: Dante Discovery and Metering224.0.0.251: mDNS for Device Discovery (also known as Bonjour)224.0.1.129: PTP Clocking--both PTPv1 for Dante and PTPv2 for AES67239.255.254.253: Shure Control, for Software Update Utility239.255.255.255: Session Announcement Protocol, to announce AES67 streamsWhen each device boots up, they send a Join request to the group addresses they wish to join:224.0.1.129: All MXA910's and DSP Units239.69.20.20: Room A Front MXA910 and DSP A239.69.21.21: Room A Rear MXA910 and DSP A239.69.40.40: Room B Front MXA910 and DSP B239.69.41.41: Room B Rear MXA910 and DSP B239.255.254.253: All MXA910's239.255.255.255: All MXA910s and DSP UnitsThe IGMP Querier, running on the SG350, detects these join requests and adds the device switchports to the forwarding table along with the desired group. Now each device will receive Multicast traffic for the groups it has joined. Note that the devices do not ask to join 224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233 or 224.0.0.251, because those groups are assumed to be flooded to the local subnet. If the switch is configured to Filter Unregistered Multicast Traffic, then those two groups will not be sent to all devices, and they will not be able to see each other via mDNS, nor will the Engineer PC be able to query the Dante chipsets for information. You would need to manually add these groups to the Multicast Forwarding Database and elect which ports should receive them.Once all devices have joined their desired Multicast groups, they will not be flooded with undesired traffic, some of which may be measured in tens of megabits per second."}

{"prompt":"1) How do I confirm the correct tracking angle of 15 deg.? 2) Do I set the antiskate to the 1 gram at stylus or the 1.5 gram with the dynamic stabilizer?","completion":"1) This is done using a vertically modulated, recorded signal. It is a distortion measurement that gives a reading for several signals, each representing a certain vertical recording angle. Our equipment to do this is no longer available.The minimum distortion on one of these bands indicates the vertical tracking angle of the cartridge. Most of our cartridges are between 20 and 25 degrees, every sample being slightly different. You can't tell by looking at the cartridge.2) The dynamic stabilizer reduces the actual stylus pressure by 1/2 gram. Set antiskate to equal the actual stylus pressure.As an example, if you want 1 gram of actual stylus pressure and you want to use the dynamic stabilizer, set the tonearm tracking weight to 1.5 grams. The anti-skate should be set to equal the actual stylus pressure, i.e., 1 gram.If you intend to use the dynamic stabilizer AND you want 1 gram of pressure on the stylus, set the tonearm tracking weight to 1.5 grams; set the antiskate to 1 gram."}

{"prompt":"I need to rack my VHF wireless receiver in an equipment room. To get good reception, I need to remote the antennas into the same room that the transmitter is in. How do I properly do that?","completion":"Antennas are measured in terms of the wavelength of the signal that they are designed to pick up. The standard antenna supplied with Shure VHF wireless systems is a \"1/4-wave\", meaning that it is 1/4 of the length of the radio wave being received.For good performance, the following guidelines should be observed when remote mounting antennas:Use 1/2-wave antennas or 1/4-wave antennas with a ground plane. Do NOT remote-mount the standard 1/4-wave antennas supplied with the wireless system. When this antenna is removed from the receiver chassis, its impedance changes dramatically. This causes a significant loss of signal strength, because part of the signal is reflected back into the antenna by the cable. A 1/2-wave antenna’s performance stays the same regardless of how it is mounted.Place antennas properly. Antennas should be mounted away from large metal objects or surfaces, which cause reflections that can reduce signal strength. Antennas should also be kept away from sources of RF energy, such as computers, digital devices, AC power equipment, etc. For best diversity performance, antennas should by placed from 1/2-wavelength to 1 full wavelength apart (3 to 6 feet for VHF). Wider separation between antennas does not offer significant benefit. For diversity wireless systems, both antennas must be located in the performance area, and connected to the receiver via separate coaxial cables.Use the appropriate antenna cable. For proper performance, the impedance of the cable MUST match the impedance of the antenna input on the receiver (50 ohms). An impedance mismatch causes some of the signal to be reflected back into the cable, resulting in a loss of signal level. Do NOT use common RG-59 cable, which is designed for television signals and has an impedance of 75 ohms. Different types of cable exhibit different amounts of signal loss over a specified length. More than 3 dB of loss should be considered unacceptable. It is not necessary for both antennas on a diversity receiver to be connected to identical lengths of cable; ideally, each antenna should be connected to the minimum length of cable necessary to reach the remote mounting position.For very long cable runs, an RF amplifier, such as the UA834V can be used at the antenna to boost signal level, but it also amplifies the background RF noise in addition to the transmitter’s signal. In such cases it may be better to locate the entire receiver closer to the performance area, and run a long audio cable to the mixing console. A long audio cable (balanced and line level) is less likely to pick up interference than a long antenna cable.

{"prompt":"I work in a theater where we have Shure wireless receivers. We are also running a CD player. Our problem is that the CD player is sending frequencies that are picked up by most of our receivers and cause interference when our wireless mics are on. I know this is a receiver problem, and not interference coming from the mics, because the meters on the receivers peak when we turn the wireless microphones off. Is there some type of material that can be placed around the CD player to block the frequencies traveling to the receivers?","completion":"Metal is the only thing that will reflect RF interference. But separating the CD player from the receivers by a few feet will often solve this problem. It all depends on the strength of the RF interference generated by the CD player.

{"prompt":"Is the Shure VP89 or VP88 a good choice for picking up sound effects at a baseball game?","completion":"Shure Press Release from October 2012The signature sound of any baseball telecast is that of hardwood on horsehide - the crack of the bat. Erik West, a Milwaukee-based freelance broadcast audio engineer, has made the perfection of that distinctive sound his audio calling card. Working for Fox Sports both regionally in Milwaukee and for national games there, in Chicago. and elsewhere, West has found that replacing his older shotgun mics with the Shure VP89L has taken his signature sound to a new and higher level.\"I came to the world of broadcast audio engineering from my background in mixing live music,\" says West. \"I EQ my batcracks a lot like a kick drum. I boost a little high-end snap, pull out some of the mids, and then boost some thumb on the bottom. With the VP89L, I get much more control over that than I had before. I've always been proud of my bat-crack sound, but these mics really took it over the top.\"West points to two specific qualities of the VP89L that combine to make his results better than any previous shotgun mic. \"Most shotguns are about high frequency off-axis rejection, but the first thing I noticed with the VP89L was how well it rejected low frequencies as well,\" he explains. \"The 'thump' in a bat-crack is at a higher frequency than in a kick drum - right where you would hear it in the murmur of the crowd. With the VP89L, I can still boost that the way I like, but not suffer the consequence of coloring the crowd noise. It also has very crisp highs, which I don't have to boost as much as I did before.\"The action around home plate, along with the sounds of the crowd, are key elements in achieving the goal of making home baseball viewers feel like they are in the ballpark. While exact mic positions vary with the layout of any given stadium, West's typical procedure is to position his two home plate shotguns on either side of (and behind) the backstop netting, roughly 15 feet above field level and aimed about knee-high at home plate, roughly 35 feet away.\"That positioning gives me a nice, wide sweet spot,\" says West. \"You can hear the glove-pop, the umpire, and of course, the crack of the bat. You can really hear the difference between a solid hit and a broken bat, which is great for the home viewer and the announcers.\"To augment the on-field sounds with crowd noise, West relies on another Shure field production microphone, the VP88, a mid-side stereo mic that he feels is perfect for that task. \"One thing I don't like with crowd noise is the typical technique of aiming a couple shotguns out from the broadcast booth,\" he notes. \"It's just not a good sound. For my regular gig doing Milwaukee Brewers games at Miller Park, what I do is position the VP88 directly behind the plate, directly under the robo-camera there, about 20 feet from voices, aimed into the crowd. I use the Wide setting, which gives me clear sound of things like a vendor on the left yelling 'beer here' or 'get your peanuts' coming from the right, but without picking up many individual voices from the fans, and it handles the dynamics easily when things go from fairly quiet to really loud. It's a mic position that I highly recommend, and the perfect mic for the job.\"For Erik West, the key to success is providing a sonic experience that makes viewers feel they are at the ballpark, and he knows that the VP Series mics from Shure have played a major role in improving his ability to do that. \"The VP89L long shotgun has a fatness to the low end that is really the difference between sounding okay and great on my bat-cracks,\" he concludes. \"They're also built and tested to the same standards as Shure's rock and roll mics, which I really appreciate. I tried going back to standard truck mics, but they just don't measure up. Being able to have that low-end glove pop and that woody bat sound - that's what I love about these Shure shotgun mics. It's now my signature sound.\""}

I have also heard the KSM 313 on voice at a NAMM show in the past and I was very impressed, but the environment was too loud to give me any information on its self noise. I do understand that the preamp and cable can impact noise.","completion":"As there are no electronics inside of the KSM313, the noise level is determined by the thermal noise caused by the electrons \"bouncing around\" inside of the wires. One way to lower this noise is to cool the microphone down to near absolute zero. So you will require the quietest mic preamp that you can afford. Grace and John Hardy are recommended brands."}

{"prompt":"The A15 series looks interesting, but I do not understand the function of these products. What does each do?","completion":"All Shure A15 devices have XLR connectors.A15AS - Attenuator Switchable.  The A15AS reduces the signal level from a microphone by 15 dB, or 20 dB, or 25 dB depending on the switch position.  Here is a typical use.  A microphone with a \"hot\" output level (MX418D) overloads the input of a mixer and causes distortion.  Insert the A15AS just before the mixer input to reduce the microphone signal level.  The A15AS does pass phantom power so it may be used with a condenser mic as well as a dynamic mic.A15BT - Bridging Transformer.  The A15BT is used to connect devices of different impedances and/or different signal levels.  The A15BT can also convert an unbalanced signal into a balanced signal, and vice versa.  The precise function of the A15BT depends upon which XLR end is used as the input.   Here is a typical use.  An unbalanced output from a consumer CD player must connect to a balanced mic input on a mixer.  Using an adapter cable, connect the CD player output to the A15BT female XLR; then connect the A15BT male XLR to a mic cable that terminates at the mixer.  Unlike the A15AS, the A15BT DOES NOT pass phantom power.A15HP - High Pass. The A15HP passes higher frequencies and attenuates (reduces) lower frequencies.   Here is a typical use.  A microphone is used outdoors in a high wind; the wind produces excessive low frequency noise in the mic signal.  Insert the A15HP just before the mixer to reduce the undesirable low frequency noise.  The A15HP does pass phantom power.A15LA - Line Attenuator.  The A15LA reduces the signal level by 50 dB.  Here is a typical use.  A mixer's line level output must connect to the mic level input of another mixer.  Insert the A15LA just before the mixer input to reduce the line level signal to a mic level signal.  The A15LA does pass phantom power.A15PRS - Polarity Reverser Switchable.  The A15PRS connects pin 2 of the female XLR to pin 3 of the male XLR, and connects pin 3 of the female XLR to pin 2 of the male XLR.  This polarity reversal can be undone by the switch.  Here is typical use.  Two microphones are on a lectern; one has an incorrectly wired cable causing it to have opposite polarity.  When the two mic signals are combined in the mixer, the resulting audio is hollow and thin.  Insert the A15PRS just before the mixer and reverse the polarity for one of the mics. The A15PRS does pass phantom power.A15RF - Radio Filter.  The A15RF reduces audible interference caused by AM radio, FM radio, and other types of radio frequency interference.  Here is typical use.  A choir mic in a church has audible interference caused by a nearby AM radio station transmitter.  Insert the A15RF at the output of the microphone, or at the input of the mixer.  Severe interference situations may require two A15RF units - one at the mic output and one at the mixer input.  The A15RF does pass phantom power.A15TG - Tone Generator.  The A15TG provides a continuous mic level signal of 400 Hz.  Operation requires a 1.5 V button battery.  Here is a typical use.  Multiple microphone cables are installed in a meeting room.  To check each cable for continuity, insert the A15TG into the input of each cable and test for a signal at the other end of the cable.  The A15TG does not operate from phantom power.Discontinued A15 models: A15A; A15HA; A15LP; A15PA; A15PR; A15RS.  For technical details and schematics of these devices, see the A15 Series Data Sheet from 1969."}

{"prompt":"Are there detailed instructions on phono cartridge installation and set up?","completion":"Source: AudiophiliaDate: September 1999Author: Andrew Chasin A Beginner's Guide to Cartridge Setup[The fine print: The cartridge setup procedure described here is to be used solely as a guideline, and may not be applicable to all cartridges and tonearms. If the instructions here conflict with those provided by your cartridge or tonearm manufacturer (assuming you're fortunate enough to get any), follow those from the manufacturer. Furthermore, Audiophilia will not be held responsible for any damage sustained by your cartridge, tonearm, turntable or anyone foolish enough to sneak up on you from behind while following these instructions.]With the near-complete erosion of support for vinyl playback at the retail level, audiophiles devoted to the analog disc have little recourse but to become adept at the finer points of cartridge setup. And while correctly setting up these delicate devices does require relatively vast amounts of both time and patience, the steps involved are well within the scope of the audio enthusiast with a steady hand and the right tools at his disposal.The goal of vinyl playback is to extract, as faithfully as possible, the tiny signal carved into the surface of the record by the record cutting lathe. If the stylus replicates exactly (in three dimensions) the cutter's path through the record groove, then the signal extracted should be an exact replica of the one deposited in the groove by the cutter. Of course there are many reasons why correct stylus geometry with respect to the groove is insufficient to guarantee perfect analog signal extraction, the electromagnetic properties of the cartridge's internal wiring and magnet structure, and the shape of the stylus itself being but two. Even exercising the utmost care and patience during setup, the best we can hope for is a good approximation of the original signal, which, in practice, turns out to be more than sufficient for superb musical results.Tools at a GlanceHere's a quick summary of the tools you'll likely need to install your phono cartridge:Pair of tweezersSmall needlenose pliersToothpicksNon-magnetic headshell screws, washers and, possibly, nuts if not provided by the cartridge manufacturerSmall, non-magnetic, screwdriver setStylus pressure gauge, like the Shure SFG-2A lighted magnifying glass of at least 10X powerAn alignment gauge such as the DB Systems DBP-10 (or the one provided by your tonearm manufacturer)A test record such as Hi Fi News and Record Review's HFN-11. InstallationFirstly, if your cartridge was supplied with a cover that clips over the stylus/cantilever assembly, keep it in place throughout this step and the wiring step described below - it might just prevent you from shearing off the cantilever on your $2000 cartridge during an untimely lapse in concentration!Cartridge installation begins by affixing the cartridge body to the tonearm headshell. Tonearm headshells typically contain either slots or holes through which screws (usually supplied with the cartridge, and should be of the non-magnetic variety) may be passed into the cartridge body. Slotted headshells allow for the position of the cartridge to be adjusted for correct alignment. Headshells containing fixed-position holes (such as those of the venerable Rega RB300 and Naim Aro) assume that the geometry of the partnering cartridge is such that correct alignment will be achieved using the holes supplied. Unfortunately, tonearms whose headshells contain fixed holes will not allow for correct alignment of all cartridges . They do, however, make setup of compatible cartridges relatively simple (tonearm manufacturers who advocate fixed-hole headshells usually have a particular cartridge, or set of cartridges, in mind at the time of design - namely their own or those of a manufacturer whose products are believed to work well with the arm in question).The holes in a cartridge body, meant to accept the screws which affix the cartridge to the headshell, generally come in two flavors: threaded (or tapped), and non-threaded. Threaded holes are more convenient to use, as they they obviate the need for the small, difficult-to-handle nuts required to secure the cartridge screws to a non-threaded cartridge body. If your cartridge does not have a threaded body, then you'll have to resort to using nuts to secure the cartridge screws. If possible, insert the screws from the bottom of the cartridge, through the slots or holes in the headshell, so that the nuts can be secured from above. Those lucky enough to have a tapped cartridge can simply insert the screws down through the headshell into the tapped holes in the cartridge body (it is a good idea to use a washer between each screw head and the headshell so that the tightened screw will not mar the headshell's finish). In either case, the cartridge screws should be tightened slightly so that the cartridge is somewhat secure but still allowed to move with moderate hand pressure. In the case of a fixed-hole headshell, the cartridge screws can be fully tightened as no further adjustment is possible. Keep in mind that cartridge screws should be quite snug but not over-tightened. Overtightening can distort the cartridge body or, in the worst case, cause it to crack.2. WiringOnce the cartridge is affixed to the headshell, connect the fine color-coded tonearm wires to the corresponding color-coded pins on the back of the cartridge body. While connecting the tonearm wires to the cartridge pins, always handle the wires with great care - they are fragile and can be damaged by surprisingly little force. Grab the small metal cartridge clips which terminate the tonearm wires using a pair of tweezers (never grab the tonearm wires themselves!), and guide the clips onto the cartridge pins. In some cases, the clips may be difficult to fit over the cartridge pins unless they are pried open slightly using a small screwdriver or a toothpick. Don't overdo it or the clips won't make good contact with the pins. In the event that the clips are spread too wide, they can be squeezed back together using a small pair of needlenose pliers..3. Tracking Weight(Note that if a stylus guard is still in place at this point, remove it now and leave it off through the remainder of the setup process.)To play back a vinyl disc, the stylus must make good contact with the walls of the record groove. The question is, how much downward force should be applied so that the stylus will neither lose contact with the groove wall as it traces the path of the groove, nor fail to faithfully follow the path of the groove due to excessive downforce? Cartridge manufacturer's typically specify the downforce, or tracking weight, for a particular cartridge, usually as a range of recommended values in grams. It is best to begin the process of determining the optimal tracking weight within the specified range by setting it to the highest value within that range. To dispel a common myth, a cartridge given insufficient tracking weight is more likely to cause damage to the groove wall than one whose tracking weight is set at the high end of the recommended range. This is because a cartridge that is tracking too lightly will tend to lose contact with the groove wall, or mistrack, on highly modulated passages, causing damage to the groove as it bounces about in an attempt to regain contact.There are several devices available currently which can be used to measure tracking weight. The Shure SFG-2 stylus pressure gauge is the most popular due to its low price and reasonable accuracy. The Shure gauge works essentially like a balance: the stylus is placed in a recessed groove at one end of the balance, and a sliding counterweight, towards the opposite end of the balance, is moved along a calibrated scale in an effort to counteract the weight of the cartridge. When perfect balance is achieved, the weight of the stylus against the balance can be read directly from the calibrated scale. Although the results achieved with the Shure gauge are approximate at best (results are dependent on the accuracy of the calibrated scale, as well as the user's ability to visually judge the degree of balance achieved), they are more than good enough in most cases.Shure states that the SFG-2 is accurate to 1/10 of a gram for tracking weights less than 1.5 grams. For cartridge's that track at heavier weights, it is, in my experience, more realistic to expect measurements taken with the SFG-2 to be accurate to within 2/10 of a gram. Still, given the fact that tracking weight can vary by as much as a few tenths of a gram as a cartridge tracks record warps, the Shure gauge should prove sufficiently accurate for most installations.For those who desire the ultimate in accuracy and convenience, the Winds ALM-01 Arm Load Meter, accurate to 1/100 of a gram, is a must-have. At about $800, however, this item is only for those vinylphiles with the deepest of pockets (a less expensive alternative is the ALM-1, accurate to within 1/10 of a gram, priced at about $500). A competing device, soon to be released by cartridge manufacturer Clearaudio, is to retail for approximately $375, although its accuracy is unknown at the time of writing.The Winds gauge is surely the simplest and most accurate gauge I've ever had the pleasure of using. It is completely electronic in nature and is, therefore, not prone to the errors inherent in balance-style devices such as the SFG-2. Use of the gauge is trivial: the user must first zero its LCD display using the built-in calibration wheel. The stylus is then lowered onto a circular sensor located on the top surface of the gauge. After a few seconds, during which time the LCD display gradually converges on a numeric value, the tracking weight can be read from the display.The only gripe I have with the Winds gauge is that I found it to produce wildly incorrect results, with no warning, if its 9 Volt battery is not fully charged. Considering its price, the omission of a low battery indicator is inexcusable, especially in view of the consequences of setting a cartridge's tracking force terribly wrong (that is, after all, why one would want to use a gauge like the Winds in the first place!).Before attempting to set the cartridge's tracking weight using a gauge and/or a test record, it is best to zero-balance, or \"float\", the arm with the cartridge affixed. This provides a good reference point from which to begin to increase the tracking weight towards the desired value. The arm/cartridge is floated by moving the arm's counterweight either towards or away from the headshell until the arm reaches a point at which it floats with virtual weightlessness. At this point, the tracking weight of the cartridge is approximately 0 grams and can be set accurately using a gauge like one of those described above.4. Arm Height: Part OneWith the stylus pressure set to the high end of the manufacturer's specified range, it's a good time to adjust the height of the tonearm so that the arm tube is roughly parallel to the platter. You'll fine tune the height of the arm later in the setup process, but getting it set parallel now will make later adjustments that much easier. Most arms allow for some form of height adjustment. Inexpensive arms, like the Audioquest PT series, typically provide a set screw which holds the arm pillar in place, which allows for a wide range of adjustment but makes it difficult to repeatedly find previous settings. More expensive arms, like the Graham 2.0 and the VPI JMW, provide more sophisticated height adjustment mechanisms which contain finely calibrated scales and allow previous settings to be repeated with great ease. The Rega RB300 is one of the few arms in its class that provides no height adjustment mechanism. However, small spacers can be placed under the arm to raise it to the desired height.Don't fuss too much over the height of the arm at this point. You'll have plenty of time to obsess over it with typical analog retentiveness later in the process.5. AlignmentRecords are cut using a cutter head that is positioned at a tangent, or parallel, to the cut groove. With a pivoted tonearm, which forces the stylus to trace an arc across the record surface, only an approximation to the cutter head's tangential path is possible. The seminal work of Baerwald ca. 1941 showed that the tracking error of a pivoted stylus could be minimized if the stylus is aligned such that it is parallel to the groove at two points along its curved path: specifically, at the two points that are a distance of 66 and 120.9 mm (or 2.6 and 4.76 inches) from the center of the spindle (note that these numbers assume that the inner and outer radii of the record's grooves are no smaller than 2.375\" and no larger than 5.75\" respectively, which is, thankfully, the case for most records). These two points are commonly referred to as \"null points\" as a tracking error of zero is achieved when the stylus is tangent to the groove at these points. A commercially available cartridge alignment gauge can be used to align the cartridge such that it satisfies the tangency requirements at the null points.Most modern cartridge alignment gauges, such as the popular D B Systems DBP-10, are designed to produce correct Baerwald two-point alignment, although there are some that are designed using a less common one-point method (the alignment jig that is included with the VPI JMW tonearm, for example). When aligning a cartridge for tangency using any alignment protractor, it is essential to remember that you are attempting to align the cantilever (and, hence, the stylus), not the cartridge body. There is no guarantee that the cantilever is perfectly aligned within the cartridge body, so simply aligning the cartridge body will not necessarily produce the desired result. Furthermore, many cartridge bodies have non-parallel sides, making tangential alignment of the cartridge body with the lines of tangency on the gauge virtually impossible.Most alignment gauges are simply cardboard, plastic (or, in some cases, glass) templates onto which are printed or scribed the null point(s) and lines of tangency against which the cartridge should be aligned. The template is placed over the turntable's spindle (made possible via a spindle-sized hole drilled in the template) and placed against the platter. The cartridge's position in the headshell is then manipulated until the stylus is parallel to the gauge's lines of tangency at the null point(s). This process is made somewhat easier by the use of a small, lighted magnifying glass which will allow you to better view the near-microscopic stylus and scrawny cantilever, both usually obscured by the shadow of the cartridge body. This is, by far, the most frustrating and time-consuming part of the cartridge installation process. Making small adjustments to align the stylus with the null point(s) invariably alters its relationship to the lines of tangency - or vice versa. Keep the screws holding the cartridge to the headshell as tight as possible, but just loose enough to allow slight changes in cartridge position. With any luck, the force of the screws against the headshell will hold the cartridge in position while you check your changes against the template (if you're unlucky, the force of the tonearm wires against the back of the cartridge will negate all of your hard work up to that point!). When everything is lined up, tighten the headshell screws with one hand while holding the cartridge steady with the other. Hold the cartridge firmly in place, as the torsional force generated while snugging down the screws will tend to twist the cartridge in the headshell, thus spoiling the cartridge's tangency.While it might, at some point into this process, seem that aligning what has now become known as \"that freaking cartridge\" with \"those freaking lines and points\" of \"that freaking gauge\" is virtually impossible, take solace in the fact that you're only a dozen or so hours away from playing a freaking record.6. AzimuthWith the cartridge aligned (and the sweat squeegeed from your turntable's platter), it's time to set the cantilever's azimuth, or perpendicularity to the groove. Without a correct azimuth setting, the electrical output from the cartridge's two generators will be unequal (when reproducing a signal with equal amplitude in both channels), resulting in a channel imbalance and a shift of the soundstage to either the left or right. Be warned, however, that not all tonearms allow for changes in azimuth, the Rega RB300 being one prominent example. Other tonearms, such as the Audioquest PT family, allow for crude azimuth adjustment via a set screw at the base of the headshell. More costly tonearms, such as the unipivots from Graham and VPI, supply sophisticated azimuth adjustments, via one or more weights, that make setting and maintaining correct azimuth a relative joy.Azimuth can be roughed-in visually by inspecting the front of the cartridge while the stylus is in the record groove. Does one side of the cartridge appear to be closer to the record surface than the other? If so, then use whatever means the tonearm manufacturer provided to adjust the azimuth such that the cartridge body is parallel (within the limits of your vision) to the record surface. Once a rough azimuth adjustment is found visually, it can be fine tuned via measurement.The optimal azimuth setting is the one that produces electrical signals of equal amplitude from the cartridge's generators when signals of equal amplitude are present in both channels of the record. Therefore, if we play a record with the same signal in both channels (a monophonic record, for example), but wire one channel out of phase, then the correct azimuth adjustment is the one that produces zero (or near zero) output when the two out-of-phase channels are summed (remember that summing two signals, one out of phase with respect to the other, results in no signal due to destructive interference.)This out-of-phase, or \"null\", test, can be performed in several ways. If you've got a test record such as the one produced by Hi Fi News and Record Review (and I recommend it highly), then you can simply make use of the azimuth test track it provides. This test track consists of a mono signal with the left and right channels out of phase. If your preamplifier has a mono blend switch (which sums the left and right channels), you can simply play the test track, engage the mono switch, and adjust the cartridge's azimuth until you hear minimal output through the loudspeakers.In the absence of a test record with an out-of--phase mono track, you can simulate such a track by playing a mono record through a DIY phase-inverting cable. To build such a cable, buy yourself a cheap female-to-male patch cord from your local Radio Shack, cut one leg of the cable in half, and strip away some of the insulation around the copper conductors. Then, solder the positive conductor from one half of the cut leg of the cable to the negative conductor from the other half of the cut leg. Finally, solder the negative conductor from the first half of the cable to the positive conductor from the second half. Cover the exposed conductors/solder joints with electrical tape. You now have a cable that inverts phase in one channel. Now, connect the male end of your tonearm cable to the female end of the inverting cable you've just created, and connect the other end of the inverting cable to the inputs of your phono stage or the phono inputs of your preamplifier. Play a mono record (I use the DCC reissue of Sonny Rollins' Tenor Madness) and switch your preamplifier into mono mode. The azimuth of your cartridge can now be adjusted until you hear zero (or, at least, minimal) output from your loudspeakers.If your preamplifier doesn't provide a mono blend switch (this feature is becoming rapidly extinct, and I applaud Audible Illusions for continuing to provide one on its Modulus 3A product), then you can dial-in the azimuth of your cartridge using either an oscilloscope (if you have access to one), cartridge analyzer (if you can find one), or the rough 'n ready visual test described above.7. Tracking Weight: RevisitedWith the tracking force roughed in, alignment spot on, and azimuth nailed down, a test record, such as the terrific one produced by Hi Fi News and Record Review, can be used to really optimize the setup. In particular, the cartridge's ability to track difficult passages can be fine-tuned using several bands on the test disc. The tracking tests consist of a test tone (300 Hz in both channels at +15dB) spaced evenly across the surface of the record in order to gauge the consistency of the arm/cartridge's tracking ability. With the cartridge's tracking weight set to the manufacturer's specified maximum value, the tones produced should be pure, without any audible signs of buzzing or distortion. Be aware that buzzing in one channel only is likely the result of an incorrect anti-skating setting (discussed below), rather than a problem with the cartridge's tracking weight. If the signal is stable in one channel but unstable in another, don't increase the tracking weight in an attempt to compensate. You'll likely be able to eliminate the buzzing in the one channel when you set the anti-skate shortly.The tracking weight can now be decreased gradually until it reaches the minimum value for which the tracking tests continue to produce good results. The resultant tracking weight should represent a good balance between tracking ability and record wear. Of course, modifying the tracking weight changes the deflection of the cantilever with respect to the cartridge body. In other words, the Herculean effort you expended to get the stylus to fall squarely on the magic null point(s) of the alignment gauge has just been undone by a simple change in tracking weight (you'll soon come to realize that almost every cartridge setup parameter is affected by every other). Fix the cartridge alignment, and recheck the tracking weight and azimuth while you're at it. If that old CD player in the corner is starting to look awfully good about now, don't despair, you're getting there!8. Anti-SkateThe last critical setup parameter that can be optimized using a test record, such as the one from Hi Fi News and Record Review, is anti-skate. The so-called skating force is a vector force which tends to draw the tonearm/cartridge towards the center of the record when the cartridge is mounted in an offset headshell i.e. a headshell that is at an angle to the line of the arm tube (most modern tonearms utilize offset headshells in an effort to minimize tracking distortion). Unless countered, this force can produce uneven, and premature, wear of the walls of the record groove and stylus, and compromises the ideal spatial relationship between the cartridge's coils and magnet structure. Unfortunately, the skating force varies continuously across the surface of the record and is, therefore, difficult to combat fully. Most tonearms contain a spring-like device that applies a force in the opposite direction of the skating force with approximately equal magnitude. Some arm designers, most notably VPI's Harry Weisfeld, eschew anti-skating devices, claiming that they are a source of vibration and don't accurately and consistently counteract the skating force over the whole of the record surface. Bob Graham , designer of the Graham 2.0 unipivot tonearm, disagrees. His tonearm incorporates a unique lever/weight system that produces a variable force that does, according to Graham, change in direct proportion to the skating forces involved.Using the anti-skating mechanism provided on your tonearm, adjust the amount of anti-skate until the Bias Setting tracks on side 1 of the Hi Fi News and Record Review test record produce a clean, undistorted signal in both channels. Buzzing in the right channel indicates that more anti-skating force is required, whereas buzzing in the left channel indicates that less anti-skating force is required.9. Arm Height: Part TwoThus far, the cartridge has been aligned in such a way as to minimize the tracking error across the surface of the record, and the cartridge's azimuth has been set such that the stylus is perpendicular to the surface of the record. The last adjustment we can make in an effort to duplicate the cutter's path through the vinyl disc is to set the angle of the cantilever relative to the record surface to closely approximate that of the original cutter head. This angle, referred to as the vertical tracking angle or VTA, is changed by modifying the height of the tonearm relative to its base. As the arm height is increased, the VTA is increased, and as the arm height is decreased, the VTA is decreased. Most records are cut with a VTA of approximately 22 degrees, although it is not uncommon for a record to be cut with a VTA as low as 18 or as high as 24 degrees.Setting a cartridge's VTA is best begun by setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface (if you followed my previous advice, you will already have done this prior to aligning the cartridge). If the cartridge manufacturer was clever enough to have angled the cantilever at approximately 22 degrees to the horizontal, then setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface should set the VTA to approximately 22 degrees - just fine for playing back the majority of discs. Unfortunately, cantilevers are not always angled at exactly 22 degrees, so setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface may not result in the correct setting. Since there is no convenient way to measure a cartridge's VTA, the best one can do is experiment with different settings and settle on the one that sounds best to the ear. If you're happy with the sound you're getting with the arm tube parallel to the record surface, then leave it there and spend the rest of your time enjoying your record collection. If you want to experiment with various VTA settings, keep in mind that setting the VTA too high will cause the high frequencies to be accentuated, resulting in a bright, fatiguing presentation. In contrast, setting the VTA too low will cause the low frequencies to be accentuated, resulting in a boomy, sluggish presentation.One could spend a good portion of their remaining days on earth tweaking their cartridge's VTA. It will, after all, vary depending on the thickness of each record played. While it's worth investing a reasonable amount of time to find a VTA setting that works well for a representative sample of records in your collection, don't obsess over it. Life's too short, and there's too much music to be heard.10. Final AdjustmentsCongratulations! You're not done yet! Go back and verify that the tracking force, alignment, and azimuth settings haven't been fouled while making other adjustments. Pay particular attention to azimuth, as adjusting the arm height will likely have subtly modified this setting (although it is difficult to visualize in three dimensions, raising the height of a tonearm with an offset headshell will affect the stylus' perpendicularity to the groove).Continue to listen to your setup and make minor adjustments until you're satisfied with the results. Then put away the alignment and stylus pressure gauges, file away the test records, and kick back with a fist full of your favorite records. I think you'll find that it really was worth all the effort."}

{"prompt":"I sing in a punk band and just bought an SM58. The only problem I have with it is that even when I stand 15 feet away from our drum kit, the mic still picks up the drums or even the bass amp output and that goes through our PA system, which we want to use for only vocals. Is there any way to fix this so that the mic will only pic up close-range vocals?","completion":"If you can hear the drums and bass where you stand, then the mic can as well. Sing into the microphone very closely, less then 1 inch away, and turn down the gain on the mic channel."}
{"prompt":"Let's say we have a mic with sensitivity of -74dB open circuit for 94dB SPL, For 94dB we have -74dB = 200uV Then for an output of 200uV/2 = 100uV input SPL is 94/2 = 47dB is that correct? or do we have to convert SPL dB to linear?---- 07/12/2001 08:34 AM ----------------------------------------------OK, If I have an output of 100uV, that would equal to -80dBV, but my question was, what would be the INPUT SPL for an output of -80dBV (100uV)? In other words, if I want to plot input SPL vs output (V or dBV), what are the values for:100 uV -> ? dB SPL200 uV -> 94 dB SPL (Given by specs) 300 uV -> ? dB SPL and so on.","completion":"At 07/11/2001 04:38 PM we wrote - No, that is not correct. The dB is a logarithmic scale.If you have an output of 100 uV, that would equal -80 dBV. Every time you halve the voltage, the signal drops by 6 dB.Also see:How do I compare the sensitivity of two microphones?At 07/12/2001 10:00 AM we wrote - As you can see from the following table, the dB increase/decrease in the input (expressed in dB SPL) directly corresponds to the dB increase/decrease in the output voltage (expressed in dBV). So, if the input decreases by 4 dB, then the output of the microphone will also decrease by 4 dB. So, take the given specification, subtract 4 dB from it, and then use the equation to calculate the voltage.BTW, in audio, we hardly ever talk about raw voltage. Instead we discuss things in terms of dBV. That is why you will see that term used all the time.Equation: (value in dBV) = 20 log (voltage)  INPUT OUTPUTdB SPL uV dBV88 100 -8094 200 -7498 300 -70100 400 -68 "}

However, if deemed necessary, a 6 dB pad may be added between the output of the microphone element and the input of the transmitter preamp.Note: This modification requires the removal and replacement of surface mount components. This modification should only be attempted by a skilled technician with surface mount soldering experience. Unless performed by an authorized Shure Service Center, this modification will void the U2 warranty.Some components on the U2 circuit board are sensitive to both static electricity and heat. If static electricity discharges through these components, they will be destroyed. A low temperature soldering iron must be used so as not to damage heat sensitive components.To disassemble the U2, remove the microphone head. Next, remove the battery sleeve. Remove the single Phillips head screw located by the antenna. At the top of the U2, remove the snap ring using needle nose pliers. Remove the circuit boards by pushing at the base of the antenna.

SYNC is a one way communication link from the PGX4 receiver to the PGX2 transmitter, and only lasts several seconds. SYNC is not a continual communication link from the receiver to the transmitter.After the PGX4 performed a SCAN and found a new open frequency, the PGX2 must be re-set to the new open frequency. This requires you to open the PGX2 battery compartment, aim the PGX2 IR port at the PGX4 front panel, press the SYNC button on the PGX4 front panel, and make certain that the PGX4 READY light illumninates. Only then is the PGX2 reset to the new open frequency.There are several factors that can interfere with the SYNC action:Holding the PGX2 too close or too far from the PGX4. Fifteen centimeters (eight inches) is the optimal distance.Bright ambient light from being outdoors, or from strong stage lighting.

This article only applies to Cisco SG350-series and SG350X-series switches. It does not apply to SG200/SG300-series or SG250-series switches.Decide how IP Addresses will be managed. It is fine to use DHCP (e.g., from the switch, or from a Crestron server) or Static/Manual addressing. If you are using Static IP Addresses, create a spreadsheet to keep track of each device's address. We suggest tracking the device make, model, MAC Address(es), IP Address(es), firmware version, date purchased, and date installed. Include your switch in the list. See Documenting Your Audio Network for more information.Update your switch to the latest firmware available from Cisco. This guide was written against SG350-series firmware version 2.5.0.83.If you are using Crestron NVX or other video-over-IP solutions on the same switch, please be sure to complete the additional configuration steps under Configuring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Dante and Video.Configuring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Shure Dante DevicesIf you are not using the default subnet of 192.168.1.254 or are not using an external DHCP server, you will need to configure the switch's IP Address to match your Shure Control and Dante network. Under the Administration menu, select Management Interface > IPv4 Interface. Click the Add button, and set an IP address within your Network Audio subnet, set the correct Subnet Mask (Network Mask). Click Apply. The warning will ask if you want to replace the existing IP Address, click OK. Apply changes and reconnect to the switch if needed.Under the Port Management menu, select Green Ethernet > Properties. Ensure Energy Detect Mode and 802.3 Energy Efficient Ethernet is disabled. Verify that all ports show 802.3 as Disabled under the Operational column. Click Apply.Select Advanced Configuration Mode in the upper right corner of the screen.Under the Multicast menu, select Properties. Enable Bridge Multicast Filtering. Select IP Group Addresses. Click Apply.Under the Multicast menu, select IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP Snooping menu and enable IGMP Snooping Status and IGMP Querier Status. Click Apply.Edit each VLAN in the IGMP Snooping Menu as follows:Enable IGMP Snooping Status, MRouter Ports Auto Learn, and Immediate Leave.Enable IGMP Querier Status and Querier Election.Select IGMPv2 as the Querier version.Select Auto for Querier Source IP Address. Click Apply.Under the Multicast menu, select IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP VLAN Settings and configure each VLAN to have a Querier Interval of 30s and to use IGMPv2. Click Apply for each VLAN.Under the Multicast menu, select Multicast Router Port and set all ports to None. This will cause the switch to auto-detect a Multicast Router Port if you have additional switches (see step 15). Click Apply if needed.Under the Multicast menu, select Forward and set all ports to None. This will prevent multicast from flooding all ports. Click Apply if needed.Under the Multicast menu, select Unregistered Multicast. If you are not using any Video-over-IP devices, set all to Forwarding. If you are using Crestron NVX or similar technologies set all to Filtering and be sure to follow the additional instructions at the end of this document.

Set Trust Mode to DSCP. Click Apply if needed.Under the Quality of Service, menu, select DSCP to Queue. Set Trust Mode to DSCP. Configure the table to look like the screenshot below with DSCP 56 set to Queue 8, DSCP46 set to Queue 7, DSCP34 set to Queue 6 (or 5, doesn't really matter), and all other DSCP values set to Queue 1. PRO TIP: Tab between each field and use the number keys to set the values, it is much quicker than using the mouse. Click Apply.The switch is now configured. Save the settings and create a backup.If you have a second switch, repeat the configuration procedure for each Cisco switch. We highly advise not mixing switch manufacturers (for example, do not connect a D-Link and a Cisco switch, or use an unmanaged \"dumb\" switch to add additional ports--even if you don't have Dante devices on that device. Here are some tips for a multi-switch environment:All switches should ideally be of the same model series.All switches should share the same general configuration settings as shown above, including enabling the querier—the switches will elect one switch to be the querier. Alternately--you may elect to force one switch to be the querier, and configure all others just for IGMP snooping.Uplink switches with the fastest physical layer method possible. If there is video traffic, we highly recommend a 10 Gbps uplink between switches. In some cases Ensure the uplink ports on downstream switches indicate as a Dynamic router port on the Multicast Router Port screen. The core switch will not show links to other switches as Dynamic; this is expected and normal. Do not set this to Static; this will cause all multicast to flood that link.If no video is present, ensure uplink ports are set to Forward Unregistered Multicast Traffic on the Unregistered Multicast screen. If video is present, follow the additional instructions at the end of this document and ensure all links to child switches are set to forward the Dante traffic.Explicitly block multicast clock traffic (224.0.1.129) from any attached WiFi access points.Configuring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Dante and VideoIf you plan to use your SG350-series or SG350X-series switch with Crestron NVX equipment or other video-over-IP equipment, follow these additional configuration instructions.Under the Multicast menu, select Unregistered Multicast. Set all ports to Filtering.Under the Multicast menu, select IP Multicast Group Addresses.

Select Static for all switchports with a Shure or Dante device attached. It is perfectly fine to assign Static for all switchports. Repeat for each of the six groups listed above.Verifying Your WorkConnect all of your Shure devices to the network switch, and if necessary, assign them a Static IP address.Open Dante Controller and ensure all devices appear under the Device Info tab.Verify that only one device is the Leader Clock on the Clock Status tab. All other devices should say Follower. If you are using AES67, we generally recommend that the same device serve as both the Dante and AES67 Leader Clock.Open Shure Update Utility, and configure it to use your Ethernet adaptor. Verify that all devices appear in the list, and are on the latest firmware.If devices do not appear, please troubleshoot according to these directions: Update Utility Stuck in \"Discovering\" or device not showing upRoute your audio as desired, and ensure it is working correctly."}
{"prompt":"What do you recommend for the best reproduction of mono LPs? I read in one of your FAQs that shunting the two channels of a stereo cartridge together would be an okay procedure for combing the two channels into one output line. Would a mono cartridge (if such a thing exists) and/or stylus be give better results than stereo cartridge and stylus?","completion":"Paralleling the outputs of a stereo cartridge is the best approach. To our knowledge, monophonic pickups for 33 rpm LPs are no longer manufactured.A modern stereo phono cartridge is superior to monophonic cartridge as it has horizontal and vertical compliance. This will provide less record wear and damage because a monophonic cartridge tended to be very stiff in the vertical direction.A Shure stereo cartridge, wired for monaural, will do a fine job reproducing monophonic records.

{"prompt":"Hi, I don't know much about these in-ear-monitors, but how would they help prevent future hearing loss? Do they act as earplugs too? Are they too loud right up close to your ear? See my family has a history of hearing loss, and I hate using earplugs cause then I can't hear the music, so how would these help with that problem.","completion":"The main purpose of personal monitors is to hear yourself better. But it doesn’t do any good if you can’t hear at all. As mentioned earlier, volume wars on stage are a universal problem. Prolonged exposure to extremely high sound pressure levels can quickly cause hearing to deteriorate. Some performers have taken to wearing ear plugs to protect their hearing, but even the best ear plugs cause some alteration of frequency response. Personal monitors offer a level of hearing protection equal to that of ear plugs, but with the additional benefit of tiny loudspeakers in the plugs. The monitoring level is now in the hands of the performer. If it seems to be too loud, there is no excuse for not turning the monitors down to a comfortable level. The use of an onboard limiter is strongly recommended to prevent high level transients from causing permanent damage. In larger, complex monitor rigs, outboard compressors and limiters are often employed to offer a greater degree of control and protection.NOTE: Using a personal monitor system does not guarantee that you will not or can not suffer hearing damage. These systems are capable of producing levels in excess of 130 dB SPL. Prolonged exposure to these kinds of levels can cause hearing damage. It is up to the individual user to be responsible for protecting his or her own hearing.More info on page 12 and pages 25-26: Selection and Operation of Personal Monitor Systems"}
{"prompt":"Which microphone would be best for the following application: Approximately 4 ft. round table; min. of two persons, with as many as 5 persons at table; relatively quiet surroundings; base of mic perhaps hidden in a flower arrangement; hard wired ok..have existing 3 pin hookups.

{"prompt":"I have a VP88 mike which I use in conjunction with a Canon XL1 camcorder. The mic is superb - no complaints there. 1) However in my application I have to use the 6v battery to power the mike. Or do I? I am looking at powering the mike externally. 2) Can I power the mike from another source by attaching a couple of wires to the 6v battery connections? 3) If so what are the limits of voltage and required current? 4) For example can I use an external 9v or even 12v battery? Would that simply blow the power circuitry? 5) Another possibility is that the XL1 has a socket through which it provides power for an external mike. The supplied Canon mic uses this as it's power source. At this point I am not sure of the voltage and current provided by the source, but if it is within the tolerance of what the VP88 can handle, then I can simply wire this power supply from the XL1 to the 6v battery connections.","completion":"1) Yes, you need to use the internal 6 V battery in your application.2) No.3) The proper way to externally power the VP88 is via phantom power: What is Phantom Power?4) You can use an external battery IF you built a phantom supply: Battery Powered Phantom Power Supply with Balanced OutputYou will need two as each leg (the LEFT and the RIGHT) of the VP88 output must be powered.5) This will not power the VP88. The Canon provides bias, not phantom.Summary: Build or purchase two battery phantom supplies; OR use the internal 6V battery."}

{"prompt":"I am researching this for a customer of mine. He is a teacher, and is sure that at his last school there was a system which was able to power up to 6 wireless mics using only one receiver. I have been in the business a long time and have not heard of this before. I do not believe the product was Shure. Do you make, or know of anything? ","completion":"Every transmitter must operate on its own frequency. That means there must be a corresponding receiver for each individual transmitter. That receiver must also be on the same frequency. It is possible to design systems that house multiple receivers in the same physical box. We do offer some systems that house 2 receivers in the same physical box: the BLX88, the SLXD4D, the ULXD4D, and the AD4D.Since every audio system is different, we feel it is generally better to design separate receivers for the transmitters. This allows maximum flexibility when designing a complete audio system."}

{"prompt":"Several times in reading about audio cables and wires I have heard the term \"audio common\" used. Could you explain to me what the audio common is? Sometimes it seems as if they are talking about the ground wire, but I am not sure.","completion":"A balanced microphone cable requires three wires: a shield (which carries no audio information) and is connected to XLR pin 1; inner conductor \"A\" (which carries the \"hot\" audio signal) and is connected to XLR pin 2; inner conductor \"B\" ( which carries the \"cold\" or \"common\" audio signal) and is connected to XLR pin 3.The signal on pin 3 is the mirror image of the signal on pin 2. In technical terms, it is 180 degrees out of polarity with pin 2. A balanced input on mixing board only responds to the signal difference between pins 2 and 3. This is also called a differential input.On a professional microphone, pin 2 provides a positive voltage and pin 3 provides a negative voltage when the microphone diaphragm receives a positive pressure wave that pushes the diaphragm inward. Thus, pin 2 is \"hot\"; pin 3 is \"cold\" or \"common\".To read more about balanced line, please refer to page 11 of: Microphone Techniques for Music - Sound Reinforcement  How a Balanced Input WorksHow an Unbalanced Input Works"}

{"prompt":"I just acquired a pair of 819LPS mics and have a couple of questions. These appear to be very similar in design to the Beta 91's although I believe the intended purpose is a bit different. Judging by the datasheets it appears that the 819's and 91's have a similar mic element. The 819 was stated as having a permanent low-cut filter which would account for it's rolled off bass response. Am I correct in assuming that these are very similar mics with just a slight difference in the internal preamp? Also...is the pinout on the output connector the same as a standard XLR? If I get a \"QG\" connector and wire it like a standard XLR (to a XLR-M) will it interface properly with a mic pre?","completion":"The 819 used the same cartridge as the SM91. The Beta 91 uses a completely different and new cartridge.The pin out of the Tiny-QG connector on the 819 is not the same as an XLR, and it cannot be plugged directly into a mixer.

Note, though, that the separation between the mixes that are on the same transmitter will only be about 35 dB. That is, there will be a small amount of bleed from one mix to the other."}
{"prompt":"On our recently acquired Shure TGD wireless guitars systems there are two RF lights. Right out of the box, we powered on the system, receiver and transmitter.

{"prompt":"Each of the two audio inputs on the DFR22 System Processor has a phoenix-block connector and an XLR connector. Is it possible to simultaneously feed audio from two different sources into both of the connectors simultaneously?","completion":"It is permissible to feed audio into both the phoenix-block and XLR input connectors simultaneously on each input channel. Both the phoenix-block and XLR input connectors are wired together, but through 600 Ohm bridging resistors.  This provides adequate isolation between two different audio sources that will prevent their output drivers from loading each other. This will also minimize the effects of changing the gain structure should one source device be disconnected from time to time.The typical output impedance of a pro-audio device is typically very low, often in the 50 to 100 Ohm range.  The typical input impedance of a pro-audio device is often in the 10,000 to 20,000 Ohm range.  Connecting a low impedance output driver to a typical medium impedance input provides excellent signal voltage transfer and very good signal to noise ratio performance.  If two low impedance driver outputs are wired directly together as a \"Y\" connection to combine their signals, it will probably work. The complication is that each output driver stage will load each other unnecessarily due their very low impedance.  To combine two low impedance outputs together, bridging resistors are recommended to provide some isolation between the output drivers."}

Could you tell me about it and what is its value?","completion":"Information on the 55SW can be found at our discontinued product page.As for the value, go to ebay and see the prices of other comparable microphones.Also see: Vintage Microphones - Value? Buying and Selling?   "}
{"prompt":"I know that the length of an antenna cable run negatively affects the RF signal strength delivered to the wireless receiver, and that using 75 ohm cable instead of 50 ohm also negatively affects the RF signal. All things being equal, which typically causes more loss of the RF signal?","completion":"RF signal loss due to the length of the cable run is far more significant than loss due to an impedance mismatch. Using a 100 foot run of 75 ohm antenna cable with low loss is better than using a 100 foot run of 50 ohm antenna cable with high loss. There are different grades of 75 ohm cable and of 50 ohm cable. Check with the cable manufacturer to determine the loss per 100 feet for the cable grade being considered.Professional wireless microphone antennas are 50 ohms, and therefore 50 ohm cable is preferred. If 75 ohm cable is used, add 0.4 dB of loss for this impedance mismatch, no matter the length of the cable run. For example, a 100 foot run of 75 ohm RG6U has a loss of 6 dB (at 500 MHz) when used with a 75 ohm antenna. When used with a 50 ohm antenna, the loss is 6.4 dB [6 dB + 0.4 dB for the impedance mismatch.]"}
{"prompt":"Does the 55SW model require phantom power before plugging into the amp or PA?","completion":"No. The \"power source\" is an internal permanent magnet. The 55SW is a dynamic microphone. A dynamic microphones does not require phantom power.   "}

Would a similar cartridge [i.e. one from a 515] work at all?","completion":"The 581SB had a very short life, i.e., it never sold well. The element was a Unidyne A design. Shure has not built the Unidyne A element for over 35 years. The 515 used a Unidyne B element. The A and the B elements are similar but not identical. There are electrical differences and dimensional differences.Your question is like asking Ford \"Can I fit the engine from a 1985 Mustang into my 1965 Mustang?\" The question makes sense, but likely no one at Ford could answer the question as manufacturers do not spend engineering time \"hot-rodding\" their products. The same is true at Shure.The 515 element was the R180. It's probably not worth reviving a mic whose performance was mediocre at best? Our advice: save your money. "}

The mics were installed 120 cm height, 150 cm away from the instrument, lid half open. What should I do different?","completion":"Nothing went wrong. To find the sound the pianist prefers, you need to experiment with the microphones placement within the hall. Mic placement is an art and can only be learned via experimentation and experience.Move the mics closer to the piano; move them farther away; put them up higher; put them down lower; rotate the piano.....etc. etc. etc. And make detailed notes on each location and the resultant sound quality.See also: How do I mic a piano?"}

WIll this work, as I push up the locked channels two and three I get increased spread? Or does Two need to be M+S and Three M-S?","completion":"Input channel One is the M output of the VP88. This input must be panned to the Left Output channel and the Right output channel.Input channel Two is the S output of the VP88 (in phase). This input must be panned only to the Left output channel.Input channel Three is the S output of the VP88 (phase reversed). This input must be panned only to the Right output channel.When inputs two and three are fully attenuated, the output is monaural only.

Should I raise it up a little or is this not the correct mic for the job? We play Rock and Roll.","completion":"The SM91 was a popular bass drum mic (it has been replaced by the Beta 91A). But perhaps it does not suit your taste. Many customers prefer the Beta 52, a mic designed from scratch as a bass drum mic.Before you give up on the SM91, experiment with placement. Where it will sound best depends upon the internal acoustics of your bass drum. Try placing it on a pillow to isolate it from the drum shell.Mic placement is more art than science.

Could I run into any problems with the tonearm if I track them at less that 1.5 grams?","completion":"1. Set the tracking force for 1.5 grams. It is within the range of the tonearm and the new stylus.2. Perhaps, it depends upon the physics of the tonearm design. Try 1 gram and if it sounds fine, use 1 gram."}

These changes are documented via internal/confidential Engineering Change Orders (ECO). When a product has been discontinued, its ECOs are archived off-site and eventually destroyed. This is necessary as a company creates a lot of paperwork in 95+ years.Perhaps a vintage mic collector may have useful information for you."}
{"prompt":"I am at my wit's end, so I'm hoping you have some helpful feedback. I record using an SM57, and ART Tube MP preamp, and my computer. This combination allowed me to make pristinely clean recordings until I moved to a new house eight months ago. I now get a very loud buzz, and sometimes an FM radio station, when using the equipment (even minus the computer), which precludes any real recording activity. I have tested the equipment in other people's houses with no problem whatsoever. My outlets are grounded. The power company has no answers for me. What may be causing this, and what can I do about it?","completion":"Your new house is located in an area with strong electronic fields of an unknown origin. Unless you move again, this situation will not change. So.......Solving interference problems (buzzing, RF, etc.) is a process of elimination. Doing it via email is next to impossible, but here are some suggestions:Fabricate an \"audio dummy load\". Buy a male XLR connector. Across pins 2 and 3, solder a resistor (any value between 100 ohms and 200 ohms). Reassemble the XLR connector. You have created a dummy load.Unplug the SM57 from your setup. Replace it with the dummy load. If the problem goes away, it is the SM57 that is picking up the interference. Since the mic works well elsewhere, it is not defective; but it is not shielded well enough for the stray electronic fields in your house. Try the SM58; the Beta 57; the Beta 58. If none of these solve the problem, try a condenser mic: any Shure KSM mic; the Beta 87; the SM87; etc.If the SM57 is not the problem, unplug the mic cable for the ART. Replace it with the dummy load. If the problem goes away, you need a cable with better shielding.Continue the process through the entire signal chain. This is lead you to the component (or components) that are picking up the buzz and RF.Finally, there are some electronic fields so strong that using audio equipment within the field is not possible. Let's hope that is not the case in your new house.Also see: How does Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) occur?"}
{"prompt":"What general gauge and wire type do you need to make a short XLR microphone cable extension? If the XLR connector has an additional lug for the connector case, do you jumper that to pin 1 (shield)?","completion":"Mic cables are typically 22 or 24 gauge.Connection to the case is usually not necessary, as that is typically already done in the mic or electronic device."}
{"prompt":"Recently our church purchased 3 Beta 87s for the vocalists. My worship pastor later found out that the 87s aren't good for that general \"every Sunday\" sort of use but they are really made for \"Live recording\" purposes only.

What are the main differences between both models of mics and what are the main \"live\" [foh] sound differences? ","completion":"The Beta 87 and SM58 are completely different microphones. The Beta 87 is a condenser and the SM58 is a dynamic. The Beta 87 has a supercardioid polar pattern and the SM58 has a cardioid polar pattern.

{"prompt":"After many my V15 type V has slightly fallen apart. The adhesive which held the cartridge body onto the mounting hardware has come loose. I believe the cartridge is still in fine shape, unfortunately it's no longer usable. How can I reglue it?","completion":"We suggest a clear epoxy. Nothing special - just go to your local hardware store.Clean off the old adhesive for the metal body and the plastic shell. Slightly roughen each surface with fine sandpaper so the epoxy can grip. Apply a small amount of epoxy to both surfaces. Clamp it and let set for 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"I was wondering if you could provide me with some info on a microphone manufactured by Shure for Wilcox Gay.

Chicago, U.S.A.\" I've attached a jpeg to help identify it. I understand you may not be able to offer the definitive answer since this was an OEM product, but I'd appreciate any help you could offer. Another related question I've been meaning to inquire about has to do with the 510C controlled reluctance microphone. I'm curious what element the 510C used? Is it the R5 as found in some of Shure's \"bullet\" mics? If not can you tell me which element it did use and if this element is used in other Shure microphones?","completion":"Shure made many OEM variation of the model 510C. Your mic is one of these OEM variations. It was made before 1956; Shure moved to Evanston from Chicago in 1956.We do not have a data sheet in our archives for a model 806 or 808. This is not unusual for an OEM model. Our records do not indicate which mic element was used in the model 510. It was likely a close cousin to the element used in the \"bullet\" mics, but probably not exactly the same.Another OEM variation of the Hercules microphone was the CR84A that was sold to Motorola for use with their two-way radios.Related: The History of Controlled Reluctance Microphones From the Shure Archives"}

{"prompt":"I heard that the human body, by virtue of its water content, absorbs RF energy emitted by a bodypack transmitter. Is there any science behind this?","completion":"The human body is both a reflector and an absorber of RF energy. This is likely to be even more apparent at higher frequencies, e.g. 2.4 GHz. Try this experiment. If you have a portable FM radio, tune in a station and do a 360 degree spin. Note how the station fades as you turn your body.Positioning a large human body between the transmitter's antenna and the receiver's antenna can cause a degradation in RF performance. The human body is made up primarily of \"salt water.\"  Salt water is an effective absorber of RF energy.  (Submarines have to surface to send FM radio signals.)   The more body fat a person has, the more RF is absorbed.   Our tests show that a body pack transmitter can be 50 to 70% less effective than a handheld transmitter simply because of the antenna location being against the human body. Thus the reason RF antennas in theatres are often placed above the stage...closer to the actors wearing the body packs.Attached is an excellent technical paper (PDF file) on this subject from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology."}

Can you tell me how I can tell if it needs to be replaced, ie, what I should look for? I believe this would require that I use a magnifying glass or microscope, but I don't know exactly what to look for. Since a new stylus for the V15 III is relatively expensive, especially when I plan to use it so infrequently, I don't want to replace it unless it is really worn out.","completion":"How old is the stylus?

{"prompt":"Is there a replacement for a VN45MR stylus?","completion":"The VN35MR fits the V15-IV body and can be used as a replacement for the VN45MR. The VN35MR does not have the dynamic stabilizer (brush) of the VN45MR, and the frequency response will be brighter when used with the V15-IV body."}
{"prompt":"Why is the V15IV stylus no longer available?","completion":"Regarding the scarcity of replacement styli for the V15 Type IV cartridge:A quick history of the V15:V15 1964-1966V15 Type II 1966-1970V15 Type II Improved 1970-1973V15 Type III 1973-1978V15 Type IV 1978-1982V15 Type V 1982V15 Type V-MR 1983-1993V15 Type VxMR 1996-2004One distinctive difference between each generation of the V15 is the shape and dimensions of the Pole Pieces and Stylus Brass Housing. This means that the styli are not interchangeable from one generation to the next. They do not provide a proper fit, or alignment, between the Magnet and Pole Pieces.In general, it has been Shure’s practice to provide a replacement stylus for premium products for 10 years beyond a particular product’s discontinuation. This is typically accomplished by estimating a 10 year demand, and producing that quantity, before the tooling and assembly line is retired. In some cases we under estimated, in some cases we over estimated.In 1983, Shure introduced the Micro-Ridge (MR) diamond for the V15 Type V. Shure also offered the Micro-Ridge diamond on replacement styli for V15 Type III and Type IV. Again, long term quantities were estimated and produced. Circumstantially, the tooling for the V15 Type V allowed for additional production of Type III replacement styli. This accounts for the larger availability of Type III and Type V replacement styli.Shure experienced dramatic shifts in demand for phono cartridges when the CD Player was introduced in the late 1980’s. In the early 1990’s cartridge sales plummeted, OEM business ceased, and Shure gave serious consideration to ending all phono production.In 1995, under new phono management, Shure re-engineered our phono products and manufacturing process to allow us to produce significantly lower quantities, maintain our quality standards, locate reliable suppliers, and maintain a fair market price. The action allowed Shure to remain in the phono cartridge business, but unfortunately, required that we cease to support pre-1995 products beyond the final inventory build-ups.For V15 products, a replacement stylus was available for at least 5 year after the cartridge was officially discontinued. Some inventory usually remained in the retail channel for 2-3 years.Shure’s inventory of VN45E, VN45HE, and VN45MR styli completely expired in the late 1990’s. We are unable to re-produce this part due to scarcity of tooling and raw materials."}
{"prompt":"I have the V15 IV and one of my children has recently wrecked the stylus. My enquiries reveal that the VN45HE stylus is no longer available. Is there another more recent stylus that I can use?","completion":"The VN45HE is no longer manufactured by Shure.The VN35MR stylus will fit the V15 IV body and may still available via replacement styli dealers. Note that the VN35MR does not have the dynamic stabilizer/brush. A VN45 stylus is required to obtain the original performance of the V15 IV. "}

{"prompt":"I am installing a P4800 and need to place multiple mute switches around the installation. That is, I'm wanting to use an AMX system as a master control to mute outputs, but I also want to place a couple switches around the installation to mute and unmute particular channels. How can I do that?","completion":"Follow this diagram:The diagram shows lighted switches, to help indicate if the input or output is muted. In order for the AMX system, the LED's, and the switches to follow each other, the switches need to be momentary. Make certain in the Control Pin Configuration of the P4800, you select a momentary switch.For example, the AMX system has a touchpanel button that toggles the mute of output 8. Control In 8 of the P4800 is set up to mute output 8 with a momentary switch. Two switches are connected in parallel to Control In 8. Now, all 3 buttons (two physical, one on the touchscreen) will toggle the mute of output 8. Also, all 3 buttons will have indication to show if output 8 is muted.With the P4800 the switch will only light when the input/output is muted. Thus, we recommend getting a switch with a white/clear lens, but a red LED. When the input/output is unmuted, the switch will be white. When the input/output is muted, the switch will illuminate red.

{"prompt":"I use the PSM700 system with several players in \"mix-mode\" with a band mix on left channel, and a vocal mix on the right. Quite often players need to mute the vocals in their ears and bring them back at other times. Mix-Mode is perfect for this, but quite often the vocal mix cannot be muted, even when turning the \"pan\" control all the way to the band mix. I took several of the units and tested them with music being sent only to the left channel of the transmitter, and listening to the receiver, panned the control. I found that it wouldn't mute the music, even with the pan control dialed all the way to the right. The weird part is that the amount of bleed changed depending on how strong the signal is. As I moved around the room, it never disappeared, but the bleed became louder at spots where I would also have some interference. To make sure it wasn't just a problem with the pan control on the receivers, I used a 1/8\" stereo to RCA cable and connected the left output only of the receiver into a powered speaker. Same problem shown. I conclude that the receiver is either bleeding a bit of the opposite channel into the other, or the transmitter is transmitting a bit of the opposite signal into the other.

{"prompt":"On the spec sheet for the SM57, you use the term \"attack\" to describe tone quality. Could you please give me an explanation?","completion":"Attack refers to the transient response of the mic.A good way to understand why dynamic and condenser mics sound different is to understand the differences in their transient response.In order for a microphone to convert sound energy into electrical energy, the sound wave must physically move the diaphragm of the microphone. The speed of this movement depends on the weight or mass of the diaphragm.  For instance, the diaphragm and voice coil assembly of a dynamic microphone may have up to 1000 times the mass of the diaphragm of a condenser microphone. The lightweight condenser diaphragm starts moving much more quickly than the dynamic’s diaphragm. It also takes longer for the dynamic’s diaphragm to stop moving in comparison to the condenser’s diaphragm. Thus, the dynamic’s transient response is not as good as the condenser’s transient response. This is similar to two vehicles in traffic: a truck and a sports car. They may have engines of equal power, but the truck weighs much more than the car. As traffic flow changes, the sports car can accelerate and brake very quickly, while the semi accelerates and brakes very slowly due to its greater weight.  Both vehicles follow the overall traffic flow but the sports car responds better to sudden changes. 38 The picture below is of two studio microphones responding to the sound impulse produced by an electric spark:  condenser mic on top, dynamic mic on bottom. It is evident that it takes almost twice as long for the dynamic microphone to respond to the sound. It also takes longer for the dynamic to stop moving after the impulse has passed (notice the ripple on the second half of the graph). Since condenser microphones generally have better transient response then dynamics, they are better suited for instruments that have very sharp attacks or extended high frequency output such as cymbals. It is this transient response difference that causes condenser mics to have a more crisp, detailed sound and dynamic mics to have a more mellow, rounded sound. Condenser/dynamic scope photo "}

{"prompt":"How do I connect a professional microphone to a video camera, like a Sony A7S or a GoPro?","completion":"There are now a very wide variety of digital video cameras on the market, all with different audio connections and feature sets.Types of InputsDigital cameras use a variety of microphone input connectors and wiring schemes. Unfortunately, there is no standard to which camcorder manufacturers must adhere, and the specifications provided with the camcorder often say little or nothing about the microphone input. Most camcorder microphone inputs fall into one of three groups, however; the trick is knowing which group your camcorder is in. The key questions are:Is the camcorder mono or stereo? If it is stereo, we assume that you wish to record the audio from your microphone onto both the Left and Right channels. This is commonly the case for most Mirrorless and DSLR cameras on the market.If it is mono, does the microphone input jack supply DC voltage (sometimes labeled Mic Power or +3 vdc) for the manufacturer's own accessory microphone? This DC voltage is not the same as the phantom power used for professional condenser microphones. Microphones or wireless receivers that do not require this power must be connected in such a way as to avoid contact with it. Professional condenser microphones requiring phantom power cannot be directly connected to a camcorder; a separate phantom power supply is required.If the camcorder is stereo, are there separate mono input jacks for the Left and Right channels, or a single stereo input jack that feeds both channels? If there are separate mono jacks, do they supply DC power (see above)?Is a transformer necessary?If the length of cable between the microphone and the camcorder will be 20 feet or less, all that is necessary is to use a cable with the appropriate connectors and wiring. If the cable will be longer than 20 feet, however, a transformer will be required at the end of the cable nearest the camcorder. The camcorder-side of the transformer is typically equipped with a very short cable and a 3.5mm mono or stereo connector. The transformer provides two benefits:The transformer maintains a balanced connection between itself and the microphone, minimizing pickup of hum and electromagnetic interference and allowing for cable runs of up to 1,000 feet. (Longer cable runs require a mixer or preamplifier to boost the microphone signal up to Line level, about 1 volt.)The transformer can boost the signal level slightly, which may be useful when connecting a low-output microphone (or one used at a considerable distance from the sound source) to a camcorder whose microphone input is not very sensitive. The amount of boost (called gain) that the transformer provides depends on the ratio between its input and output impedances, as well as the ratio between the transformers output impedance and the camcorders input impedance. Typical transformers provide between 6 dB and 12 dB of gain.Can a mixer be connected to the camcorder?The output of a mixer can be connected to a camcorder's Mic input if the mixer has a Mic level output. If the mixer only has a Line level output, its level must be attenuated (decreased) by approximately 50 dB to prevent overloading of the camcorder's microphone input circuitry. Some camcorders have a Line level input in addition to the Mic input.If the cable run from the mixer to the camcorder is longer than 20 feet, a transformer is required as discussed previously. Note: the mixer must have a Mic level output, OR the transformer must be capable of handling a Line level signal from the mixer without being overloaded (most cannot).Automatic Gain ControlMost consumer-grade camcorders and some industrial models have an Automatic Gain Control (AGC), which adjusts the audio level up or down as necessary. The AGC circuit is designed to compensate for the fact that the sound source is often far from the microphone on the camera. An external microphone is usually placed much closer to the source, however, and therefore a much higher signal level is fed into the camera's input. The Automatic Gain Control responds by rapidly reducing the audio level during the peaks of speech, and boosting the level up very high during pauses. The sound of the AGCs action is often described as pumping, breathing, or whooshing, and is usually undesirable.How to reduce the effects of AGCIt is impossible to defeat or bypass the AGC on most camcorders. The only other options are:Use the camcorders line-level input, if it has one. On most camcorders, the line input is not affected by the AGC. But since a microphone signal is not strong enough to drive the line input directly, the mic must be connected to a mixer or microphone preamplifier that has a line level output. Using a mixer also allows for more precise adjustment and metering of signal levels, in addition to its basic function of combining the signals from multiple microphones into one feed.Keep the external mic signal level very low. This causes the AGC to relax and let the audio level rise to maximum. This tends to amplify the hiss of the cameras audio circuitry, but reduces the pumping action. The microphones output signal can be reduced by moving it farther away from the source, or by using a device called an attenuator or pad, which decreases the signal level by a fixed amount. Some attenuators offer a choice of settings, such as -15 dB, -20 dB, and -25 dB.SourcesInterfacesBeachtek: Makes many XLR to 1/8\" adapter boxes with volume controls and mixing functions.Adapter CablesMarkertek 800-522-2025SC10XJMZ: microphone cable with female XLR connector on mic end and 3.5mm stereo miniplug on camcorder end.

{"prompt":"What is Antenna Distribution? When do I need to use it?","completion":"Proper antenna distribution is key to achieving optimum performance from multiple wireless systems operating in the same environment. Our Wireless Accessory Wizard will tell you when an antenna distribution system is recommended, and how to hook it up. Here are some of the benefits of antenna distribution:Stacking or rack mounting wireless receivers results in many closely spaced antennas, which is not only unsightly and a physical challenge, but also degrades the performance of the wireless systems.Antennas spaced less than 1/4 wavelength apart (about 12 cm / 5 inches at 600 MHz) disrupt the pickup patterns of one another, resulting in erratic coverage.Closely spaced antennas can aggravate local oscillator bleed, which is a potential source of interference between closely spaced receivers. This is particularly problematic on older analog systems.Antenna distribution is essential to keeping the number of remote antennas and coaxial cable runs to a minimum.The antenna distribution unit can often power the wireless mic receivers, reducing the number of power outlets required.Antenna distribution eliminates these issues by splitting the signal from a single pair of antennas to feed multiple receivers. This split can be accomplished by either passive or active means.Passive Splitters (2 receivers)Passive splitters are inexpensive and do not require any power to operate. Using a passive splitter results in a signal loss of about 3 dB for every split. As a general rule, no more than 5 dB of loss is acceptable between the antennas and the receiver inputs. For this reason, passive splitters should only be used for a single split (i.e., splitting a single antenna to two receivers). An additional consideration with passive splitters is the presence of DC voltage on the antenna inputs of some receivers. This voltage is usually present for powering remote antenna amplifiers directly off a receiver. If two receivers are connected together with a passive splitter, each receiver will “see” the voltage from the other receiver at its antenna inputs. Depending on the design of the receiver, this may be a problem. To avoid any potential damage, either use a splitter that incorporates circuitry to block the voltage (such as the Shure UA221), use an external DC blocker, or defeat the voltage on at least one of the receivers.This diagram shows how to share a single pair of antennas with two receivers:Active Antenna Distribution (3 or more receivers)If distribution is needed for more than two systems, an active antenna distribution system is recommended. Active splitters require power to operate, but provide make-up gain to compensate for the additional losses resulting from multiple splits off the same antennas. A typical active system will have 4-5 antenna outputs. Many active antenna distribution systems will provide power distribution to the receivers as well. Multiple active distribution systems can be used together if more outputs are needed, but this must be done carefully. A theoretically perfect distribution system would provide unity gain from input to output. In practice, the antenna outputs of an active system may have as much as 1.5 - 2 dB of gain. Over-amplification of the radio signal can cause unwanted side effects, such as aggravated intermodulation products and increased radio “noise”. To prevent these problems, it is strongly recommended to not cascade antenna distribution systems more than two deep. A better method is to use a \"primary\" antenna distribution system to split the signal to a second tier of “secondary” distribution systems. All receivers are then connected to either the “primary” or “secondary” distribution systems. Connecting receivers in this manner keeps all the receivers closer to the pure antenna signal. Pay attention to the frequency bandwidth specified for the antenna distribution system. They are typically available in both wideband and narrowband varieties. Wideband refers to a device that will pass frequencies over a large range, typically several hundred megahertz. “Narrowband” devices may be limited to no more than 20 or 30 MHz. Since these are active devices, frequencies outside the bandwidth of the distribution system will not pass on to the receivers.This diagram shows how to use a \"primary\" and \"secondary\" antenna distribution unit:What kind of distribution should I use?2 receivers: Use a passive antenna splitter4 - 5 receivers: Use a single active antenna distribution systemsMore than 5 receivers: Use multiple active systems connected in a hierarchical arrangementTry our Wireless Accessory Wizard to more closely model your exact system and get a bill of materials to order."}

{"prompt":"I have a minister who has a Shure wireless system. He has trouble when he is not directly on the lavalier (turning head or moving) I cannot tell if the mic that he has is the omnidirectional or not. I see no numbers on it. It is small, oval shaped with windscreen and clip. What lavalier would you recommend that I order for him that would be the most omnidirectional and would be compatible with his other components? He will not switch to a headset mic.","completion":"The problem is physics, not the incorrect microphone. If a talker varies the distance between his mouth and the mic, the audio level will rise and fall accordingly. A headworn mic works best because the mic stays a constant distance from the mouth.If the preacher insists upon a lavalier mic, he should learn to turn his whole body when he looks left or right, and not just turn the head. Turning the body helps keep a constant distance between the mic and the mouth.The lavalier mic he is using is likely an omnidirectional pattern, but if you want to order him a new one, get the WL93 or the WL183."}

{"prompt":"I have several Shure model PE588 Unisphere-B microphones that are high impedance. These mics were purchased new in 1975. Can these microphones be re-configured to be low impedance? I would like to use them in conjunction with Shure SM57 microphones in a recording environment.","completion":"The simple solution is add a Shure A95U High-to-Low Impedance Transformer to the end of the PE588 cable. The A95U will provide a balanced, low impedance output signal via a male XLR connector.The complicated solution is to bypass the internal Low to High impedance transformer inside of the PE588 handle. This can only be accomplished if: 1) You have experience with electronic circuits and you can use a soldering iron; 2) The PE588 handle is NOT filled with an epoxy-like material sealing the transformer into the handle. If this is the case, you cannot reach the transformer to perform the bypass.If the transformer is reachable in your PE588 and you have the necessary technical skills, please contact us again and we will provide details on how to bypass the transformer.The transformer will be completely bypassed. From the coded (typically a red dot) terminal on the mic element, run a wire directly to XLR pin 3. From the uncoded terminal, run a wire directly to XLR pin 2. From the center terminal (ground), run a wire directly to XLR pin 1.If you want the on/off switch to function, wire it in parallel to XLR pins 2 and 3. Have the switch short pins 2 and 3 together when the mic is to be \"off\"; and unshort pins 2 and 3 when the mic is to be \"on\".Check the polarity of each rewired PE588 against an SM57. Connect the PE588 into mixer input #1; connect the SM57 into mixer input #2. Set the input controls on both channels to be the same. Talk into one mic; then talk into the other mic; then bring both mics close together and talk into both at the same time.If the polarity on the rewired PE588 is correct, the mixer output level will go up slightly when talking into both mics. If the polarity is incorrect, the output level will decrease significantly. In this case, remove the PE588 XLR connector and reverse the wires soldered to pins 2 and 3.   "}

{"prompt":"I am an installer and at present doing a retail store consisting of four floors. Which model of your wireless microphones will work on all four floors, if the receiver is placed on any one of the floors?","completion":"That depends on how large the floors are, the construction material used in the floors, the construction material used in the walls, how much background RF radiation there is, etc. We cannot guarantee that any or our systems would work in the manner that you described. For penetration through walls, the UHF system would work the best. It's actually the small wavelength of the frequency that is most beneficial. You should take one of these systems to the building to try it and see how the performance is. If the system does not cover all the floors, then you may need to have 2 pairs of antennas that get combined through a UA221 splitter/combiner. In this manner, you could place 1 antenna on each of the 4 levels of the store. This should provide adequate coverage.You can also place a receiver on each floor of the store. These 4 receivers would need to be on the same frequency. The audio output of the receivers would then need to be routed to an automatic mixer so that only one receiver would send audio at a time.Related: Antenna Distribution - 4 rooms, 8 antennas"}

DJ VariationFollow guidelines for Standard Hi-Fi.Pull the cartridge back 1 - 2 mm in headshell.You may opt to include headshell weight. This adds more mass to the tone arm and provides increased stability for some DJs.Zero the tone arm and add three grams. When using the headshell weight, avoid the tendency to increase tracking force unnecessarily.  Unorthodox VariationThis technique is chosen by some DJs. Try your preference of Standard or DJ variation.Remove the tone arm counter weight and install it backward.Slowly add weight until you get the desired skip resistance.This procedure adds 2 grams to the tracking force range. We do not recommend that you push the counterweight completely forward.Chapter 323 Degree Trick Some DJs increase skip resistance by angling the cartridge away from the spindle 23 degrees.This technique emulates a straight tone arm.The outer groove wall will wear slightly faster than the inner groove wall.Chapter 4How to Zero The Tone ArmStop the platter.Install the cartridge.Twist the counterweight as far back as possible. The tone arm should be pointing up.Slowly twist the counterweight forward until the tone arm/cartridge barely floats above the record. (Think of the balance scale from science class.)Hold the counterweight still and twist the dial to zero.The tone arm now has \"zero\" weight.Slowly twist the counterweight inward until the dial indicates your desired tracking force.Chapter 5Tone Arm HeightTone arm height should be level or only slightly down. This allows for proper stylus alignment in the record groove.If the tone arm is too high, the angle of contact where the diamond touches the groove changes shape. A spherical stylus may touch the groove at an angle resembling an elliptical stylus.If the tone arm is too high, the diamond tip can be pulled behind the curve of the record groove. This requires the cartridge to be positioned forward in the headshell.Chapter 6Stylus OverhangStylus overhang is the distance between the diamond and the inner cuff on the headshell.Optimum overhang for accurate listening on an S shaped tone arm is 52mm (Technics 1200s). On Vestax PDX-2000 straight arms, optimum overhang is 50mm.Optimum overhang positions the diamond slightly forward of the curve in the record groove, and has in inward pull on the tone arm.The diamond is seated evenly between the left and right walls of the record groove.Positioning the stylus at the tangent point of the record groove can increase Skip resistance.Actual optimum overhang position will vary with tone arm height and scratch technique.Chapter 7Anti-Skate S Shaped tone arms have a natural pull towards the inside of the record.Anti-skate is a tone arm feature that exerts an outward push away from the spindle.Anti-skate has two calibration settings. The dial at the base of the tone arm is a relative setting that adds 1-3 grams of outward force. Absolute Anti-Skate force is adjusted using the two concentric screws on top of the pivot joint. Shure recommends that a qualified turntable technician perform adjustments for Absolute Anti-Skate.Test for Anti-Skate calibration.Zero the tone arm.Set Anti-skate to Zero.If the tone arm pulls outward, a positive anti-skate force exists. Seek a turntable technician for calibration.If the tone arm pulls inward, a negative anti-skate force exists. Add force using the dial until the tone arm floats freely, with no inward or outward pull.Positive anti-skating forces increase skipping when back cueing.Chapter 8Tone Arm Variation (S vs. Straight)S shaped tone arms (Technics 1200) position the diamond slightly in front of the curve in the record groove. S shaped tone arms have a natural inward pull, which can be off-set with anti-skate.Straight tone arms (Vestax PDX2000) are designed to place the needle perfectly tangent to the curve in the record groove. By design, the straight arm has no natural inward or outward force on the tone arm.Chapter 9\\Stylus GeometrySpherical - The diamond is shaped like an upside down traffic cone. The front view and side view are equal. Spherical diamonds have the largest surface contact with the record groove, resulting in lower pressure per square inch, lower record wear, and acceptance of heavier tracking forces.Elliptical - The diamond is shaped like an oval traffic cone. The front view is 3 times wider than the side view. Elliptical diamonds have smaller surface contact and higher pressure per square inch. Elliptical diamonds yield more accurate high frequency response, but are NOT suitable for scratching.Chapter 10Cleaning the Stylus The stylus should be cleaned with a miniature brush and warm water.Always pull the brush long ways from back to front.Never brush side to side, as this will damage the cantilever.Over time, dirt that has not been removed can harden on the stylus, changing its shape and reducing performance.Chapter 11Quick Fix Skip ChecklistTracking force? Too much?Stylus overhang?Tone arm height?Anti-skate?Break-in time?Chapter 12Non-Needle Skipping FactorsLoose tone arm assembly.Loose spindle hole on the record.Slip mat.Unstable table.Violent, yet unrefined, scratch /juggle technique."}

The rear rejection of the 55SH is about 10-15 dB at most frequencies. In comparison, the SM57 and SM58 have a rear rejection of about 20 dB at most frequencies. Since this is due to the design of the microphone cartridge used in the 55SH, there is nothing that can be done to the microphone to help this issue. The things that can be done is to get the microphone closer to the performer's mouth and farther away from any loudspeakers.Feedback: Fact and Fiction"}

{"prompt":"Whenever the transmitter is turned on now, the FPGA ERR! stays up on the display. Is there any way to reset the transmitter or update the firmware?","completion":"ULX-D transmitters displaying FPGA ERR! can usually be restored by updating the firmware again without changing the receiver's firmware version. Follow these steps:Locate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4” – 6” from the receiver’s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.Place the handheld or bodypack transmitter on the stand you found in Step 2 and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.Begin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.When the two are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.Press ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter. Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.If the update fails, attempt it a few more times.In a very limited set of circumstances where a transmitter was being updated from version 1.5.6 or earlier to a new firmware version, and the IR update was interrupted during a particular part of the FPGA update, the transmitter may refuse to accept a firmware update using the procedure described above and will continue to display FPGA ERR!. In these cases, it is sometimes possible to recover the transmitter using an older ULX-D receiver running firmware 1.5.6 or earlier. Not all receivers can run firmware 1.5.6.If your receiver is in the J50A, L50A, V50 or X52 band or the receiver has a hardware revision of Rev1 (or later), you will be unable to follow the instructions below. To determine the hardware revision of the receiver, navigate to the Device Utilities menu and navigate to Version. There will be a field called HW. Rev0 receivers can be reverted to firmware earlier than 2.3.x, but Rev1 (and later) receivers cannot. If you are unable to follow the instructions below, contact Shure Applications Engineering for further guidance on this FPGA error issue.IMPORTANT! There is some risk in \"rolling back\" a ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver to firmware version 1.5.6. In some circumstances, you may not be able to restore the receiver to later firmware easily. Please be sure to follow the steps in ULX-D Firmware Update and Issues to change the firmware version of a ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver.If the ULX-D receiver has hardware revision Rev0 and it is in the G50, H50, J50 or L50 band, you may be able to recover a ULX-D transmitter which cannot otherwise be recovered with normal firmware updates from a receiver on recent firmware.Download ULX-D firmware version 1.5.6 (June 2014) for the receiver that you have. This will be either ULXD4, ULXD4D Dual or ULXD4Q Quad.Use an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac or PC directly to the network port of the ULX-D receiver. Do not attempt firmware updates via WiFi.Run SUU and ensure the receiver appears under Update Devices. If it does not appear, see Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't Display.Click on the Firmware tab, and at the bottom, click Import. Select the files and open them. SUU will import them.Click on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver line and select 1.5.6.Unselect the checkbox next to the transmitter line for each receiver. You must leave the newer (2.x.x) transmitter firmware in this field.Click Send Updates. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware with version 1.5.6.Once this completes and the receiver reboots, turn on the ULXD1 or ULXD2 displaying FPGA ERR!.Locate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4” – 6” from the receiver’s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.Place the handheld or bodypack transmitter on the stand you found and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports.

Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.If the update fails or seems to complete after only 30 seconds or so, the update was unsuccessful and you should try again. You may need to attempt the update multiple times.After successfully updating the transmitter, use the Shure Update Utility to update the firmware on the receiver to 2.0.28 and then to the latest version. Please carefully follow the instructions here: ULX-D Firmware Update and Issues. IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to update directly from 1.5.6 to the latest firmware!If this process doesn't seem to work after a few attempts or you find it too confusing, please feel free to contact our Applications Engineering Department at 312-736-6006 (M-F) and we will be happy to assist."}

{"prompt":"I have several Shure SM82 Line Level mikes that I use for voice-over recording on laptop computers. The line-level output enables me to by-pass the cheap mike pre-amps used in most laptops. I've been powering these mikes with Energizer EN177A batteries. Unfortunately my only source for these cells no longer carries the 177A. I've tried several 48V phantom power supplies, but they all seem to cause noise in these mikes. Is there a currently-available 110V AC power supply (or a battery-powered external supply that uses a more common, easier-to-find battery) that Shure recommends for use with the SM82? Or, is there another, more-readily-available battery that will fit these mikes?","completion":"An external phantom power supply should operate the SM82 in a quiet manner.In 1975, Shure made the A82BA battery adapter that stacked seven 1.5 volt cells in series, thus providing a 10.5 battery. We no longer make this adapter but you might be able to fabricate one yourself."}
{"prompt":"I have two of these microphones which I use for football & baseball coverage in stadiums. These microphones can be powered either by phantom power from the console or by an internal battery. The original Eveready 177 battery provides 9.8 volts, this is a mercury battery & has been discontinued due to environmental issues. Presently we've rigged some watch batteries in a cardboard tube but would like to find a better solution?","completion":"The 9.8 volt mercury battery used in the SM82 microphone (Duracell TR177) has been discontinued due to environmental constraints on the use of mercury. A company called Exell makes the only replacement battery that comes close to the specifications. The replacement battery is rated at 10.5 volts. This new battery is a retrofit but could cause damage to the zener diode in the SM82 circuit.Although the SM82 can be powered via 12-52 volts of phantom, using any internal battery with greater than 10.5 volts actual voltage is \"dangerous territory\". The 11-volt, 5% tolerance zener diode in the microphone helps protect the SM82's condenser circuitry. But if the battery exceeds the 10.5-11 volt maximum, the SM82 will begin to draw excessive current from the internal battery. This will most likely damage the zener diode, thus making the microphone susceptible to further damage if use with phantom power.Shure's position is that no matter the rated voltage of a battery (most new batteries exceed their rated voltage), the measured voltage of any SM82 replacement battery should be 10.5 volts maximum.The best course is to use the Exell battery after slightly discharging it. This can be done by putting a 1/2 watt, 500 ohm resistor across the terminals for a few minutes until the voltage goes to 10.5v. Then it should be safe to use. http://www.exellbattery.com/"}
{"prompt":"A customer of mine asked me three questions regarding his SM82: What was the retail cost? Are they phantom powered? What application are they used for?","completion":"The last U.S. suggested retail price of this microphone was $410.00 in 1989.The SM82 was powered by a 9.8 volt battery or by phantom power.This microphone was a rare type of microphone in that it had a line level output rather than the typical microphone level output. It was used for such things as TV remote broadcasts where having a mic preamp would be awkward."}
{"prompt":"Is there any way to raise the monitor level on an FP33 mixer? It seems like it's much too low.

I read the manual, but I'm not really sure what all that means.","completion":"1) The headphone jack on the FP33 is controlled by the headphone volume control on the front. Simply turn up the headphone volume control on the FP33 so that it matches the Sony output. If the mixer signal going to the headphones is then too loud (when you take it off of monitor), simply adjust the \"Level R Pot\" and \"Level L Pot\" inside the FP33. Instructions are on page 7 of the pdf (or page 5 of the printed version) of the User Guide.In other words, you can't adjust the monitor level, but you can adjust the mixer level that is sent to the headphones.

I use the Shure IEM's and always complained to the sound tech the sound being too direct. It says that the Beta87C creates more \"NATURAL\" sound. Should I purchase this mic over the old reliable 58's?","completion":"The SM58 is a dynamic mic with a cardioid pattern; the Beta 58 is a dynamic mic with a supercardioid pattern.The Beta 87C is a condenser mic with a cardioid pattern; the Beta 87A is a condenser mic with a supercardioid pattern.You have shown a preference for a cardioid pattern having chosen the SM58 over the Beta 58, so the Beta 87C might be to your liking.HOWEVER, sound is subjective. We cannot predict that the Beta 87C will be to your liking. It will sound different than the SM58 in a side by side comparison. Will it sound better? That is a personal decision that only you can make.We recommend that you do not buy the Beta 87C until you have a chance to compare it to your SM58."}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between the UC and ULX wireless systems?","completion":"The ULX systems are frequency agile wireless systems, tuneable over a 36 MHz range in 25 kHz steps, for a total of 1440 different frequencies.

{"prompt":"I wanted to inquire about phantom power. I read your small thing about it and am not sure about some of the language. If a mic uses phantom power, but the mixer doesn't have an XLR input...will it still work correctly? A mic I want to get uses 48 volts of phantom power, but I don't have a mixer that has the XLR jack...just a typical quarter-inch jack. Will it still work to its best ability?","completion":"Phantom power is typically supplied only by a mixer with an XLR input. If the mic requires phantom to operate and not phantom is present at the mixer input, the microphone will not produce a signal.You must purchase an external 48 volt phantom supply. The mic connects to this device. The output of the phantom supply connects to your mixer. In general, mixers that only have 1/4\" phone jack inputs are not of professional quality. The mixer will be the weakest link in your signal chain."}

You have mentioned that DJ cartridges are not recommended for home use. Is there any particular reason? Do I have to replace my cartridge with a non DJ cartridges?","completion":"Typically, the phonograph cartridges that you want to use for regular home listening should have a tracking weight of less than 2 grams and be flexible (compliant) to reduce wear on the vinyl.DJ cartridges tend to be less compliant and use a heavier tracking force so that the stylus won't skip and break in use.To prevent excessive wear on a long term basis, a hi-fi cartridge is best."}
{"prompt":"In the MX202 series, what mic would be best for choir pick-up (cardioid, supercardioid, or omni-directional)?","completion":"The Cardioid and Supercardioid would be the best choices as these are directional pick up patterns and will minimize feedback and background noise pickup. The cardioid is the one usually recommended for choirs as it has a wider pickup pattern that the supercardioid. A cardioid will pick up a larger number of people per mic. The supercardioid has a narrower pick up pattern than the cardioid. The narrower pattern is useful to further reduce the pickup of unwanted background sounds.Related: Difference between Cardioid and Supercardioid"}

{"prompt":"When you put tape around the 1/8 inch screen, just below the writing, does it change the pattern of the microphone?","completion":"This will alter the polar pattern in a very negative manner. The pattern will be become \"semi-omnidirectional\" and the frequency response will become very rough and irregular. Placing tape on a directional microphone will always cause problems if the tape covers any acoustical opening, grill, or port.Tape placed on the solid portion of a microphone handle is fine. This is often done for identification purposes."}

{"prompt":"I am interested in purchasing the wired Beta 58A microphone. I went to your website and checked it out. I noticed in the detailed description it does not mention whether or not this microphone has the pop filter in it. I assume it does but could you tell me if this one has the pop filter and if it does is it like the SM58 or does it have the 3 stage like the Beta 87A. My problem in the past with other microphones is the popping sounds when I sing words with p, t and b's. I've also had a problem in the past with other mikes that make my voice garbled and not clear. I would like to know if my voice will sound clear with this mic. Does this microphone minimize this and other breath noises as well as the rumble from handling the microphone?","completion":"The Beta 58A does have an internal pop filter, but it is not a 3 stage pop filter like the Beta 87A. If you find that you have excessive popping for breath blasts, you should try moving the microphone closer, farther away, or placing at the corner of your mouth so it is not in direct line with the breath blasts.Handling noise is a function of the internal shock mount, not the pop filter. The Beta 58A does have a very good internal shock mount.The sound of the Beta 58A will depend on your particular voice. We recommend that you visit your local Shure dealer and audition different models."}
{"prompt":"How can I reduce or remove the P.T.T. delay of the 885TT mic?","completion":"To remove the hang time (delay between PTT release and TX drop) you'll need to remove D202 (diode) and C202 (capacitor). Replace R205 (resistor) with a jumper. "}
{"prompt":"Can I use the AES-256 Bit encryption for the wireless connection if I am using the ULXD6 or ULXD8 transmitters and a QLXD4 receiver?","completion":"Yes.  The QLXD4 encryption feature for the wireless connection can be used with the ULXD6 boundary and ULXD8 gooseneck transmitters just as it can be used with the QLXD1 or QLXD2 transmitters."}
{"prompt":"The PSM700 user guide in English on page 5 specifies for the Transmitter Input Connector, a 1/4-in phone and XLR(female), balanced. Does the balanced apply to both the 1/4-in phone, and the XLR cables?","completion":"XLR and 1/4\" input are balanced. Use balanced cables whenever possible."}
{"prompt":"How do I correctly use lavalier microphones in theater applications?","completion":"The object of most theatrical microphone techniques is to make the mics as inconspicuous as possible and provide the actors with freedom of movement, while still providing a high level of sound quality. The obvious choice is wireless lavalier microphones, which are becoming increasingly popular. Today it is common to find Broadway productions that incorporate twenty to thirty wireless microphone systems on a nightly basis. This document will present a few tips and techniques to get the best results from lavalier microphones.Place the microphone near the top of the chest, above the ear, or in the hair line. A common mistake is to place the mic near the throat, but this will lead to an unnatural sound due to a “shadow” created by the chin that will block high frequencies from reaching the microphone.Use an omni-directional mic if you have to position it above the ear or in the hair line. A side-effect of directional mics (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.) is off-axis coloration. A mic placed on the head will, of course, always be off-axis unless it is right in front of the mouth. Omni mics will sound more natural when placed away from the mouth.Consult the wig master on securing mics near the hair line. Mic cables can be secured in the hair in several ways, including wig clips, comb clips, sewing them into barrettes, bobby pins, and elastic headbands. Also, the mic can be mounted on the temple of eyeglasses.Never use \"Gaffer\" tape to secure a cable to the skin. The adhesive found on this tape can cause skin irritation, as well as just being too sticky. Suggested alternatives include surgical tape, spirit gum, medical adhesive, and clear bandage tape.Be sure to provide strain-relief for the mic cable behind the neck. The point where the neck bends needs to be the most secure. If no strain relief is present, a sharp neck movement could tug the mic out of place. Again, surgical tape and elastic headbands are good choices for securing the mic cable to the neck.Be careful not to get make-up in the opening of the microphone element. Any make-up that gets into the mic element will alter the frequency response, and could destroy the element altogether.If the mic cable is run inside clothing, tape the mic and cable to the fabric to prevent contact noise. Contact noise is caused by clothing rubbing against the mic capsule or cable. A little tape and some careful positioning can help eliminate this problem. Also, tie a simple knot in the mic cable near the microphone. This will also assist in blocking cable noise from getting into the microphone.Consult the wardrobe master to help prevent clothing noise. Clothing noise is caused by garments rubbing against each other. There is no practical way to shield the mic from this noise, so it is a good idea to plan ahead with your wardrobe people. Generally, synthetic materials make more noise than natural fabrics, such as cotton. Also, ask wardrobe to tape or sew together multiple layers of clothing to prevent rustling.Don’t be afraid to use equalization. Judicial use of high frequency boost can help brighten a mic that is covered by clothing or positioned in the hair line. Low frequency cut reduces cable noise, breath pops, and wind noise.Keep spare mics on hand at all times. Many professional theater companies consider lavalier microphones a disposable item. Condenser microphones especially can be easily destroyed in such an abusive environment. Sweat, make-up, and constant tugging on cables and connectors can quickly wear out even the highest-quality microphone. Try to inspect your mics on a regular basis by plugging them in and listening for any odd noises and crackling, or degradation of frequency response. Wiggle the cables and connectors to check for loose connections.Take the headworn approach. More and more, actors in Broadway musicals use headworn microphones. The mic placement is always consistent, and right in front of the mouth for best sound quality and better gain before feedback. Headworn mics also give you that “hip, 21st century” look!Additional Reading:  Sound Design in the Theatre;John L. Bracewell,Prentice-Hall, 1993ISBN: 0-13-825167-3"}
{"prompt":"What is the meaning \"ERROR 1\" on my U4D LCD display?","completion":"When ERROR 1 is displayed in the LCD panel of a U series wireless, it means that during power up a problem was detected in the software that controls the receiver. Usually, you can press the \"+\" or the \"-\" buttons to make the ERROR 1 message go away and continue using the system without any performance degradations. If the problem found affects the operation system of the receiver, the ERROR 1 message will not go away when you press the buttons. There is no field solution for this problem."}
{"prompt":"Can an external switch, like a toggle switch or relay, control scene changes on the DFR11EQ?","completion":"Yes. This scenario is described on the User Guide for the Shure DRS-10 switch."}
{"prompt":"I am interested in buying either a Graham Slee or KAB audiophile quality phono preamp for use with my Shure V15 Type III cartridge and Thorens TD145 turntable, however I am concerned about load requirements. The V15 requires 47khz and 400-500pf, whereas both preamps are rated at 47khz and 115pf. What problems, if any will this cause me? Will sonic quality be compromised?","completion":"No problems, but the high end will be brighter.You can add a 250 pF capacitor in parallel with each preamp input thus changing the input capacitance to 365 pF.

{"prompt":"I have a WH20 headset mike with the TA4F connector. Is there an adapter that will allow me to use this with a standard XLR mike cable, without removing the existing TA4F connector? I'd like to switch between XLR and TA4F uses, so permanently soldering a new XLR is not the best approach. If so, how would I get this adapter?","completion":"Sorry, we do not make such an adapter cable. It is possible to build your own cable, though. Wire it as follows:TA4 -> XLRPin 1 -> Pin 1 & Pin 3Pin 3 -> Pin 2Pin 2 & Pin 4 -> Not used"}
{"prompt":"Is it possible to easily convert my wireless SM58 microphone to a wired microphone?","completion":"Yes. The VPH handle can convert any Shure RPW wireless handheld cartridge into a wired microphone."}
{"prompt":"Can I rely solely on my meter to accurately set levels?","completion":"No. While meters are a useful aid for setting levels, critical listening is the best way to ensure a clean, strong audio signal.More information: Is there a difference between a VU and a PPM audio meter?"}
{"prompt":"I have an old Shure microphone model 588SB and I'm in need of a replacement cable. Could you provide me with a current part number for this cable?","completion":"The 588SB has an XLR connector on it. The cable model depends on what the 588SB connects into. If the microphone plugs into another XLR jack, use the C25J cable."}
{"prompt":"What battery fits the A15TG?","completion":"Use any 1.5 volt button cell that will fit the battery space. Examples:A76 alkaline - 1.5 volts357 or 303 Silver oxide - 1.5 volts675 zinc air hearing aid battery - 1.4 voltsNote: The positive terminal of the cell touches the A15TG battery spring, and faces the A15TG end cap.  The negative terminal of the cell touches the solder dot on the A15TG circuit board."}
{"prompt":"I am thinking about purchasing a few of these mics for recording my drumkit. It says on Shure's website that the capsule for the mic is supercardioid, so does it eliminate a lot of cymbal bleed into the mic because of this pattern? Also it comes with an Inline Preamp. Does this mean I can't use other pre amps with this mic? Is there a way to by-pass the pre amp that comes with this mic. Or does it sound so good that I'll never have to drag out the ole' Neve preamps?","completion":"The Beta 98D/S will reduce the amount of cymbal bleed due to the supercardioid pattern.The inline \"preamp\" actually is a misnomer. Condenser microphones have circuitry either internal like our Beta 87A or PGA81 or sometimes its external to allow the microphone to be small. While in some instances there is a little amplification in the \"preamp\" section of the microphone, its main purpose is to adapt the high impedance unbalanced signal from the microphone element to a low impedance balanced signal output that can handle phantom power from the mixing board.You will still need \"mic preamps\", so keep the Neve's."}
{"prompt":"I'm looking for a tie-clip single-mount mic clip to use on an SM84 Lav mic.

Call our Parts Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-8699 to see if any SM84 tie clips are still available. "}
{"prompt":"I bought a Shure 545 microphone with the 4 pin Amphenol connector. This is a plain 545, no on/off or volume control. The seller said it was wired for High Impedence(Z). High Z is what I want because I'm using it plugged into a guitar amplifier via 1/4\" male jack. My problem- The jack end that plugs into the amp became faulty; the wires broke. I disassembled it and don't know what order I should solder the wires. I know that the red wire goes right up the middle to the male 1/4\" jack. However, I don't know what to do with the black insulated wire and the clear insulated wire and the woven wire that encases the red and clear wires and cloth insulation. Also involved is that coiled spring part that the patch cord goes through before entering the connector. I can see that I have to solder some wire or wires to it.( For ground?) What gets soldered to what for high Z?","completion":"We can tell you what pins to use at the microphone connector. Your 545 microphone has a four pin MC4F Amphenol connector. Pins 1 and 2 of this connector are the high impedance output. Pin 2 is the hot. To wire this output for a quarter inch connector, connect pin 1 to the sleeve (ground or shield) and pin 2 to the tip of the connector. The mating connector to the MC4F is Amphenol's part MC4M.If you have the original Shure cable that was offered with the mic, the shield would go to the sleeve of the 1/4 inch connector and the red to the tip. The other two conductors remain un-connected.For further information, Pins 3 and 4 are the low impedance balanced output. Pin 4 is the plus (XLR pin 2), pin 3 is the minus (XLR pin 3), and Pin 1 is the ground or shield.* NOTE: It is recommended that the polarity of the 545 be checked after the XLR cable is fabricated. If the polarity is reversed when compared to other mics, like the Shure SM57 or Shure SM58, reverse the wiring of XLR pin 2 and XLR pin 3 on the 545 cable.Shure do not carry Amphenol connectors, but pre-wired cables are available from Tom Ellis - U.S. phone: 214-328-3225 or email: tellis@ellisandassoc.com.

{"prompt":"My Shure wireless system works great in the United States. Can I use it in other countries?","completion":"You can, but if caught you might be fined, have your wireless system confiscated, arrested, or imprisoned depending on the country...maybe all four. This is not an exaggerated statement.Why? I am just an innocent musician!Each country has unique regulations regarding the wireless transmission of signals and these regulations are drafted, implemented, and modified by each country's government, not by an international organization. These regulations apply to TV signals, AM and FM radio signals, two-way radio communication, and even your Shure wireless system, be it a wireless mic or a wireless in-ear monitor. Violations of these regulations, no matter how insignificant, are taken quite seriously by the government agencies that enforce them.Please explainThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates wireless transmission within the borders of the U.S. The FCC has decreed that wireless microphones may operate in the same frequency bands as U.S. VHF TV channels 7 - 13 and U.S. UHF TV channels 14 - 36. Wireless microphones are accepted in these frequency bands as long as they meet FCC specifications and do not cause interference to any TV signal. If the wireless microphone does cause interference (highly unlikely), it must cease operation.Other countries have similar agencies and within each country's borders these agencies decide how to employ the frequency bands. In certain Middle Eastern countries, the VHF frequency band for U.S. TV channel 7 (174 - 180 MHz) is set aside for military communications. So, a wireless microphone in this frequency band that operates legally in the U.S. would not be warmly welcomed in any of these Middle Eastern countries. In Japan, all VHF wireless microphones are illegal.In Europe, with the introduction of the mobile phone network based on LTE technology in the bands 790 -821 MHz and 832 - 862 MHz, these bands are no longer available for wireless microphones usage. Because of the reorganization of the UHF-TV band 470 - 862 MHz, the license regimes have changed as well. How serious are the penalties?In England, the fines can range up to $75,000. Imprisonment is a remote possibility, but the law does allow it. In Germany, a major concert event by a world renowned pop artist was shut down by the authorities five minutes before the show began. Over 10,000 attendees were sent home as the show was cancelled.  Confiscation of the illegal wireless equipment is a certainty.What can I do? My world tour starts next month!The best solution is to rent (or purchase) a wireless system in each country that you perform. This relieves you of having to confirm that the wireless system is legal for the country. Plus if you have problems with the wireless, you have a local source for repair or replacement. Operating your U.S. wireless microphone system or wireless PSM in other countries is a decision only you can make, but Shure strongly recommends that you leave the wireless in the United States.The Shure GLX-D system operates in the 2.4 GHz band.  This band is legal for wireless microphones in most countries.  However, before investing in the GLX-D, be certain to understand the pros and cons of 2.4 GHz operation."}

{"prompt":"Can I wire my SM57's to use \"XLR --> Tip, Ring, Sleeve\" cables to obtain balanced output using a 1/4\" jack? Also, it was long ago when I purchased my '57's (used for drums) and I was connecting them to a Teac Tascam porta-studio high-Z input(s) using \"XLR --> 1/4 phone\" cables. It seems to me that I had to open the mike and change one of the connections inside. Does this sound right?","completion":"It is possible to wire the SM57 to a 1/4\" balanced connector, but we have never seen any device with a balanced, mic level, 1/4\" connector. When 1/4\" connectors are used for microphone level signals, they are almost always unbalanced.How do I wire an XLR to 1/4\" adapter cable?The current SM57 is only low impedance, but many years ago, we did have a dual impedance version. To change from the lower impedance to higher impedance in the older version, follow these instructions:Remove the XLR connector insert by turning the slotted setscrew in.Unsolder the RED lead from pin 3.Solder the ORANGE lead to pin 3.Insulate the end of the RED lead with tape.Reassemble the insert in the microphone and seat the set screw securely by turning out."}
{"prompt":"I have an old 520 mic and it has a strange connector on the end of the cable. Is there an adaptor that I could use to make it a 1/4\" phone plug, high impedance connection?","completion":"The 520 was only available with an unterminated cable, i.e. there was no connector on the end of the cable. So, we have no idea what connector is currently on your microphone.If you want a 1/4 inch connector on it, the best solution is to cut off the old connector and solder on a new 1/4 inch connector. The BLACK cable goes to the tip of the 1/4 inch and the SHIELD goes to the sleeve of the 1/4 inch plug. The 520 is a high impedance model, so you do not need to change anything for a high impedance output."}
{"prompt":"Which mic is recommended for the violin? I usually play in live.

The input signal goes into the red for the pastor and soloist. I also use a compressor on each mic. What can I do with the gain structure and compressors to correct this problem?","completion":"When the red peak LED on the receiver illuminates too often or distortion can be heard in a Shure wireless system, it is because the talker or singer is overdriving the transmitter input. To prevent this from happening, turn down the transmitter input gain by adjusting the transmitter gain control. This is a screw driver adjustable control located in the battery compartment of the handheld; or located on one of the case sides of the body pack transmitter.The gain control is properly set when the red peak LED on the receiver comes on only occasionally during peaks in the audio program. The proper setting is totally dependent on the strength of the talker's or singer's voice."}

{"prompt":"Where can I get information on how to properly mic a podium with two Microflex Gooseneck mics?","completion":"If you want both mics activated at the same time, position the mic heads in the center of the podium, one on top of the other.  The mic heads can be fastened together using two small pieces of self-adhering VELCRO.  DO NOT wrap the entire mic element with VELCRO as this will adversely affect the acoustical performance.If you want the mics on either corner of the podium and the heads widely separated, connect the mics to the Shure SCM410 automatic mixer which will activate one or the other, depending on which mic is picking up the better signal. In this case, DO NOT manually activate both mics at the same time; the audio quality will be poor due to acoustical comb filtering.Or the best option: position one mic directly in the center of the podium and forget about a second mic."}
{"prompt":"I would like to use a wireless system with a lavalier mic to simultaneously provide output to an amplifier and provide output to a recorder. The intent is to provide signal to the house sound system while simultaneously making a recording of the presentations I make.

You can definitely use the wireless system in the way described."}
{"prompt":"Is the KSM32 a large diaphragm microphone or small? I've heard both...","completion":"What does large diaphragm mean?Some individuals confidently (but arbitrarily) say a large diaphragm must have an inner diameter measuring one inch or more. Although, subjectively speaking, a one-inch diaphragm is relatively large; this benchmark has no basis in acoustical theory or practice. There is a more scientific method that helps give definition to what “large” means. Scientifically, a diaphragm could be considered large if its diameter is as large as the wavelength of the highest frequency it is intended to reproduce. The wavelength of 20kHz is .678 inches under normal atmospheric and temperature conditions. Therefore by definition any diaphragm which measures .678 inches (approx. 11/16” or 17mm) or greater is large.Does the KSM32 have a large diaphragm?The KSM32 has a large, .750 inch (3/4”) diaphragm. Shure developed a diaphragm of this size to take advantage of its performance benefits over an even larger sized diaphragm. These include extended high frequency response, improved linearity and more consistent polar response at high frequencies. In addition, Shure’s special embossing process has captured the salient benefit of some larger capsules -- a more highly compliant diaphragm that provides extended low frequency reproduction. By combining a .750” diaphragm with embossing technology, the KSM32 is able to provide rich, smooth lows and balanced reproduction of any source without sacrificing clarity."}
{"prompt":"I play clarinet and tenor sax. What is the best wireless mic for both instruments?","completion":"The microphone you would be looking for is the Beta 98H or PGA98H. The Beta 98H or PGA98H can be ordered/purchased with several of our wireless systems."}
{"prompt":"I have an 8 channel mixer which sends phantom power to all mic inputs when the phantom is activated. I would like to run a SM81 and a SM58 through this mixer in a live performance situation. If I enable the phantom power on the mixer for the SM81, will it affect the operation of the SM58?","completion":"No. Any dynamic microphone with a low impedance balanced output, like the SM58, is not affected by phantom power.Phantom Power will not damage a professional dynamic microphone."}
{"prompt":"What microphone(s) would you suggest for recording a bell choir (3 octaves of bells on 3, six foot long tables in a row)?","completion":"We would suggest trying a pair of KSM137, SM81, SM137, or PGA81. You could also try a VP88 stereo microphone. You'll need to place the microphones out in the room so that you pick up the ambience and natural reverberation of the room. It would probably sound unnatural to close mic the bells. You could try experimenting with placing the tables in a circle around a pair of microphones. Use your imagination and your ear. If the recording sounds good to you, than that's the right way to do it."}

{"prompt":"How can I have remote volume control for AMS mixers or SCM810 input channels?","completion":"The AMS8000, AMS8100, and SCM810 mixers do not have remote volume control capability. This is possible using third party equipment. Radio Design Labs makes a voltage controlled amplifier that will interface with Shure mixers to provide remote volume control.Radio Design Labs of Carpinteria Beach, CAph. 805.684.5415 fx. 805.684.9316model ST-VCA1To connect the ST-VCA1 to an input channel:Modify the mixer’s Direct Out so that it functions as a Send/Receive jack. This Send/Receive patch point is before the input gain control and before the AMS/SCM810 mic activation circuit. See the Installers Manual for detailed instructions.Connect the ST-VCA1 to the AMS/SCM810 Send/Receive jack as follows:ST-VCA1 Send/Receive jackLine Input + TipLine Input - SleeveInput Ground SleeveOutput + RingWe recommend the ST-VCA1 be set up to provide attenuation only. This prevents the remote control user from sending the sound system into feedback as the maximum level for that channel will be pre-set using the AMS/SCM810 mixer input level control."}
{"prompt":"I recently acquired a 545S microphone. It can be wired for hi-Z and lo-Z but cannot find any info pertaining to the 4 pin connector.

Pin 2 is hot.Pin 3 (XLR pin 3)  and pin 4 (XLR pin 2) are the low impedance balanced output. Pin 4 is hot. Pin 1 is the ground/shield (XLR pin 1.)The mating connector to the 545S MC4F is Amphenol part MC4M."}
{"prompt":"Can I change the frequency that my A15TG operates on?","completion":"It is not feasible to modify the frequency of the A15TG. The nature of circuit design in oscillators makes this process too complex.Oscillators can be thought of as unstable feedback systems. An unstable system is one in which an initially small excitation or disturbance produces an output that grows exponentially in time due to constructive, or positive, feedback. Typically, a relatively large feedback is necessary to get oscillation started in the first place - but once oscillation starts, the feedback must decrease so that the amplitude of the oscillation is limited at some finite value. The original large feedback is supplied by the battery. The feedback loop occurs at the emitter of the second BJT. BJT’s were invented to be used as amplifiers. If these amplifiers are put in an unstable feedback system, they oscillate. In order for this oscillation to occur, the loop gain of the system must equal one. The condition for oscillation is intuitively satisfying since when the loop gain is 1, an excitation presented to the input of the circuit will appear back at the input after some delay (after traversing the feedback loop) with identical amplitude. This “re-circulation” of the disturbance would proceed indefinitely and the circuit “oscillates” in a steady state - the fundamental period of the oscillation would be equal to the delay around the loop. This is what sets the frequency.In most oscillators the loop gain is usually only equal to 1 at one particular frequency. At other frequencies, the amplitude may be less than or greater than 1, but the phase angle would be non-zero. This means that only one frequency component can travel around the loop with no phase shift. Only this frequency component will be amplified and grow to become a steady state oscillation. An initial disturbance is necessary in order for the oscillations to start - usually, the thermal noise voltage that is always present in electrical circuits is sufficient to start the oscillations. The feedback path is dependent on three lumped impedances Z1, Z2, Z3. Z1 contains C1, R1, C2, R2, and C3. Z2 contains Q2, R5, R4, C4, and the transformer. Z3 is R3. Even if we determined the correct value of these individual parts, the odds of the loop gain being 1 and the phase angle being 0 is about one in 10,000. So, in short, it can't be done easily.For more information on the design of oscillators, please refer to the following books:Communication Circuits: Analysis and Design, Kenneth K. Clarke and Donald T. Hess, Addison-Wesley, 1978.Modern Communications Circuits, Jack Smith, McGraw Hill, 1986.Solid State Radio Engineering, H.L. Krauss, C.W. Bostian, F.H.

{"prompt":"I have an SM58 that is about a year old. It seems to work fine but I get an electric shock every time I use it and touch it with my lips. I don't use it very often (about 10 times so far) and today I took the time to swap mic cables, switched inputs on the P.A ... trying to find the source of the problem. The only thing that eliminates the shock is using a different SM58 hence I think it's my mic. What can be causing this?","completion":"You indicated that using another SM58 cures this problem, so we'll use that as part of the troubleshooting. Our initial guess is that the microphone is not being properly grounded. Either, pin 1 of the XLR is not connecting clear through to the shell of the microphone, or the grill is not making good metal to metal contact with the shell of the microphone. If you have something that will measure resistance, you can check the continuity between pin 1 of the XLR and the shell and grill of the microphone. They should all be electrically connected. If you can't check this, or you can't find the problem, send the microphone to Shure Service department to have our technicians look at it."}
{"prompt":"I am about to purchase two SM81 microphones and would like to know if they are available in matched pairs. I have been unable to find a part number for such. Perhaps the SM81 design does not require matched pairs and I am looking for something that does not exist. Are they available as a matched pair?","completion":"The SM81 is not available in a matched pair set. The quality of the microphone is such that you can purchase two SM81's at random and know that they will be the equivalent of a matched set."}
{"prompt":"How do I gate two SCM810 channels at the same time?","completion":"It is possible to do so in the Intellimix circuitry. The modification differs depending on which board revision you have. The board revision is printed in large capital letters on the upper right corner of the PC board. On any boards that start with a letter “H” or higher (e.g. HYRAX), there are holes labeled “Group Gate Jumper” for each input channel. Soldering a jumper between these points will cause these two channels to gate on as a pair. That is, if either microphone channel turns on, they both will turn on.For earlier revisions, a jumper can be placed between pin 2 of U102, U202, U302, etc. OR, a jumper can be placed between pin 13 of U103, U203, U303, etc.Note that only one point on each channel needs to be connected. (These two points are actually connected on the circuit board.) Pick whichever one is easier.After performing this modification, the “Last Mic-Lock On” feature should be disabled by switching DIP switch 2 on the back panel to the down, or off position."}

{"prompt":"Does the old PS1 power supply, not the PS1A, power a mic that requires 48 volts?","completion":"Neither will. The PS1 and the PS1A supply 20 volts of phantom. "}
{"prompt":"If I equalize the performance area with a spectrum analyzer and set my graphic and parametric equalizers adequately would I be able to get away without any feedback, or should I use an automatic feedback eliminator as a pre-caution? Is a wireless mic more vulnerable to feedback than a wired mic?","completion":"When equalizing a system for feedback control, the object is to remove any peaks that are introduced from sound system components, room modes, etc. By using equalization, the gain of the system can usually be increased 3-6 dB. An automatic feedback reducer is an equalizer. The automatic feedback reducer is easier to operate because it will provide automatic notch filters to compensate for these peaks, but it does the same job as an equalizer in dealing with feedback. So, if you have the equalizers set up correctly to minimize feedback, then an automatic feedback eliminator probably would be redundant.It is impossible to completely eliminate feedback whenever there is a live microphone and loudspeaker in the same room. You can always turn up louder, at which some point the system will feedback. The object is to get the sound loud enough to hear without feedback occurring.There is no difference in the feedback characteristics of a wireless versus a wired microphone assuming the microphone element is the same.Check out our online document on Basics of Equalization and Feedback."}

{"prompt":"What are the dimensions of the PS44 DC coaxial connector?","completion":"Historically, all Shure products fitted with co-axial DC connectors have used plugs with 5.5mm OD and 2.1mm ID. This has been the case with both locking and non-locking connectors.The PS44 power supply, used with the UA844 antenna distribution amplifier, uses a connector with slightly different dimensions. Specifically, it is 5.5mm OD and 2.5mm ID.Two items result from this:The co-axial connector of the PS44 will physically mate with all of our existing (and historical) locking-connector-equipped products. However, it will not make electrical contact with the (2.1mm) center pin. Thus, no power will be applied to those products.The co-axial connectors of all of our other existing (and historical) power supplies will not physically mate with the input DC co-axial connector on the UA844US.This was done to prevent attempts to power up the UA844US by any supply other than the PS44, since none of them has anywhere close to the required current capability (3.3 amps).The only downside is that the PS44 can't be used to directly power any other device even though its voltage and current capability may be suitable. A connector change (to a 5.5mm x 2.1mm) would allow this in an emergency."}
{"prompt":"How do I use Microflex Ecosystem solutions with Logitech Video Collaboration products? ","completion":"What does the partnership between Shure and Logitech mean?

Rooms designed around the Logitech RoomMate benefit from including Microflex Ecosystem products to fit any room size or type. See our example room diagrams. Logitech-centric meeting rooms using compatible products can all benefit from using microphones, DSP, and loudspeakers from the Microflex Ecosystem range to bring best-in-class audio to your classroom or meeting space. In large meeting rooms you should always consider discrete audio components such as Microflex Ecosystem solutions, so that everyone can hear and be heard equally. Rooms requiring distributed loudspeaker output can take advantage of the MXN5 Network Loudspeaker.  How do I use Microflex Ecosystem solutions with Logitech Video Collaboration products? The IntelliMix P300 Conferencing Processor acts as an audio interface between Logitech devices running CollabOS and Microflex Ecosystem solutions, using a driverless USB connection.  When using P300 with CollabOS products, all audio input and output must be routed via the P300. You will require external loudspeakers routed via P300 either by Dante or analog connections. We recommend the MXN5 Network Loudspeaker. If using IntelliMix Room software DSP on Windows, all your Microflex Ecosystem products – including the Teams Room or Zoom Room PC - will send and receive audio over the local network, eliminating the need for a USB connection between your audio devices and the PC. When using IntelliMix Room software DSP installed on a PC, in combination with MXA microphones and a Rally Bar, MeetUp, or Rally Bar Mini (all in USB mode), you can route loudspeaker audio to those devices while maintaining MXA mic audio. However, it is not possible to split audio input and output sources when using P300.  "}
{"prompt":"Can I calculate the speech to background noise level at a microphone?","completion":"Predicting Speech to Background Noise Ratio at the MicrophoneA microphone is the first component in any speech recording or transmission system. Its function is to convert acoustic sound waves into an equivalent electrical signal. This signal can then be recorded, transmitted, amplified, or modified. However, a microphone cannot effectively sort out desired \"noise\" (speech) from undesired background noise. Also, a microphone cannot improve the acoustic environment in which it is placed.What are acceptable speech to noise ratios?Fundamental psycho-acoustic research states that intelligibility is a function of speech to background noise ratio.If speech level is 0dB to 10dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be unacceptable to poor.If speech level is 10dB to 20dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be poor to fair.If speech level is 20dB to 30dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be fair to good.If speech level is 30dB to 50dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be good to excellent.How to predict if speech will be intelligible at the microphone location.At the desired mic location, measure the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) A weighted. Make certain all background noise sources are operating, e.g. air conditioning, fluorescent lights, equipment cooling fans.Example: Background noise measures 46dB SPL A weightedMeasure the distance (in feet) from the farthest talker location to the mic location. Assuming that the talker produces 68dB SPL at 1 foot, use this formula: 68 - 20log(distance in feet). This provides the SPL of the talker at the mic location.Example: Farthest talker is 8 feet from microphone. Working out the formula gives:log of 8 = 0.90.9 x 20 = 1868 - 18 = 50dB SPLSubtract the background noise SPL from the talker SPL at the mic location. Compare the result with the speech to noise ratios listed above.Example: 50dB SPL(talker) - 46dB SPL (room noise) = 4dB This is unacceptable to poor intelligibility.What to do if the predicted intelligibility needs to be improved?Move the microphone closer to the talker. or...Make the room quieter via acoustical solutions. or...Both of the above. or...Accept the predicted level of intelligibilityTHERE ARE NO OTHER SOLUTIONS!Important Note:This bulletin does not address the intelligibility problems that can be caused by a reverberant room. Echoes and reflections from hard surfaces (glass, marble, hardwood floors, etc.) can ruin speech intelligibility even if the speech to background noise ratio is acceptable. Intelligibility problems caused by reverberation must be solved by adding acoustical treatment to the room or by moving the microphone closer to the talker."}

I've asked people in music stores and no one has heard of this problem. Have you? ","completion":"Yes, this is rare problem associated with the type of volume control. Some volume potentiometers produce very low levels of RFI (radio frequency interference) as the pot's wiper moves over the carbon trace. This RFI is sent to the wireless transmitter via the connecting cable and is heard as audible noise when you move the pot. The RFI is not a problem when using a cable to your amplifier.The only solution we know of is to change to a different type of volume pot. Conductive plastic pots usually do not have this RFI problem. Clarostat is a manufacturer of such pots.Good luck. This can be a difficult problem to solve.

{"prompt":"I recently bought a PGA81 mike to record piano and violin. I'm very happy with the sound when recording the piano. However, it seems to lose a lot of bass when I use it to record the violin. I noticed on the frequency response chart that the low frequency is lost when the mike is more than 3\" from the source. Unfortunately, I have to keep the mike a couple of feet from the violin, because the performer moves the violin too much. Since there's so much loss in bass, the violin sounds very thin when I record with the PGA81. It doesn't sound as rich as the real thing. Can you suggest a better microphone for recording the violin?","completion":"The reduction in bass response you are experiencing is due to proximity effect. This effect is common to all unidirectional microphones (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.), and results in increased bass response as you get closer to the microphone. Consequently, as you increase distance from the microphone, you lose this additional bass response. Therefore, switching to another microphone that is positioned the same as the PGA81 will not cure this problem. The possible solutions are:Move the microphone closer to the sound source.Attach a miniature microphone to the instrument. (This technique tends to pick-up a good deal of mechanical noise from the instrument.)Use an omni-directional lavalier microphone on the player, either attached to the collar or tie. The Shure MX150 would work for this application.As you seem to prefer a close miked sound, you need to get the mic close!Related: Why does Proximity Effect Occur?"}

{"prompt":"I am the principal at a local high school and am interested in a microphone that can be used as a hand held or podium mic. It needs to be able to pick up from a distance without feedback. What models do you recommend?","completion":"Feedback: Fact and FictionOne of the most commonly asked questions in professional audio is “What microphone can I use that doesn’t cause feedback?” The answer to the question is, of course, that no such microphone exists. Feedback results from a combination of many factors, including loudspeaker placement, microphone placement, the frequency response of both devices, and room acoustics.What is feedback?Feedback is characterized by a sustained, ringing tone, which can vary from a low rumble to a piercing screech. Echoes and reverberation caused by room acoustics, as well as ground buzz and other extraneous noises, are not the same thing as feedback, and cannot be cured in the same manner.What causes feedback?Feedback occurs whenever the sound entering a microphone is reproduced by a loudspeaker, picked up by the microphone, and re-amplified again and again. The familiar howl of feedback is an oscillation that is triggered by sound entering the microphone. The easiest way to create feedback is to point a microphone directly into a loudspeaker. (We don’t recommend you try this!) Placing the microphone too close to the loudspeaker, too far from the sound source, or simply turning the microphone up too loud exacerbates feedback problems. Other contributing factors are too many open microphones, poor room acoustics, and uneven frequency response in either the microphones or loudspeakers.What can I do about feedback?The single easiest way to reduce feedback is to move the microphone closer to the desired sound source. Additionally, using a directional microphone (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.) will typically increase the amount of gain before feedback. Reducing the number of open microphones with an automatic mixer will also improve the situation. Try to keep microphones and loudspeakers as far away from each other as possible. Lastly, acoustically treat the room to eliminate hard, reflective surfaces such as glass, marble, and wood.When all of the above solutions have been exhausted, the next step is to look towards equalizers and automatic feedback reducers. A common technique used by sound engineers is “ringing out” a sound system by using a graphic equalizer to reduce the level of the frequencies that feedback first. After the techniques described in the above section have been applied, slowly bring up the system level until you begin to hear feedback. Now go to the equalizer and pull down the offending frequency roughly 3dB. If the feedback is a “hoot” or “howl” try cutting in the 250 to 500 Hz range. A “singing” tone may be around 1 kHz. “Whistles” and “screeches” tend to be above 2 kHz. Very rarely does feedback occur below 80 Hz or above 8 kHz. It takes practice to develop an ear for equalizing a sound system, so be patient. After locating the first feedback frequency, begin turning up the system again until the next frequency begins ringing. Repeat the above steps until the desired level is reached, but do not over equalize. Keep in mind the equalizers can only provide a maximum level increase of 3 to 9 dB. Parametric equalizers, though more confusing to the novice user, allow for more precise control of feedback frequencies. A graphic EQ allows the user to cut fixed frequencies with a fixed filter width. A parametric EQ allows the user to isolate specific frequencies and adjust the width and depth of the filter.Automatic feedback reducers will accomplish the same results as above. They find and cut the frequencies that are feeding back automatically. The same precautions listed above apply to feedback reducers as well as equalizers. Automatic feedback reducers are very helpful in wireless microphone applications. Remember that microphone placement is crucial to eliminating feedback, and the temptation to wander away from the ideal microphone position when using a wireless is great. If the performer gets too close to a loudspeaker, feedback will result; a good feedback reducer will be able to catch and eliminate the feedback faster than a human operator.Proper implementation of the above techniques will go a long way towards eliminating feedback in your sound system. Do not rely solely on equalizers or feedback reducers, and remember that feedback results from more than just the microphone!Do not purchase any mic from any manufacturer without understanding the many, many causes of feedback. The microphone is only one part of the audio chain.We recommend you call a reliable sound system installer in your area, have them visit your site, and make a recommendation of what steps to take. Your current sound system performance may be improved by adjustments or purchases other than buying a new mic.Related:How do I fix my feedback problem?When will feedback occur?

{"prompt":"My daughter's elementary school is doing a play on a conventional proscenium stage that is 24' wide and 12' deep. They have a house sound system that allows 3 mic-level inputs (that can be phantom powered at 24 volts) along the front edge of the stage. The speakers are permanently mounted on the proscenium wall on either side of the stage. I can mount 3 mics on stands in front of the stage (with the mics slightly higher than stage floor level), or perhaps place mics like the MX390 series on the stage floor. Can you make recommendations of microphone type or model? Cardioid vs super cardioid, hand-held mics in stands at floor level vs floor mounted MX390 series or others?","completion":"Place 3 or 4 MX300 series boundary microphones across the front apron (about every 6 to 8 feet) and then hang 3 or 4 MX202 microphones 6 feet back from the apron.If you use something other than boundary microphones, than we suggest the PGA81 microphones on stands. Place the microphones at mouth height. Do not use stands that only lift the microphones 1-2 feet. This will cause comb filtering due to acoustic reflections off the stage floor. How far the performers are from the microphones will determine if stand mounted microphones would be beneficial. If the performers are close to the microphones, then the stand mounted microphones would be beneficial. If the performers are further back, then the performance of the boundary microphone verses the stand mounted mic would be similar.When positioning the mics, adhere to the 3-to-1 rule. Details on this rule are in the publication listed below.Only turn up the microphones that are near the performers on stage. Turn down (off) any unused microphones. The fewer microphones that are activated, the louder the PA system can be. More mics on equals more feedback, not less.Cardioid microphones would be the best choice for this application. Finally, do not expect the \"in-your-face\" sound quality of a current Broadway theater production when using distant miking. The current Broadway sound is achieved by using multiple wireless systems on each main actor with a microphone mounted somewhere on the actor's head.

{"prompt":"I have an old M97 body, currently using a N97HE stylus. Can I use a VN35MR stylus in the M97 body? Or a VN5MR stylus, perhaps?","completion":"Sorry, but neither the VN35MR nor the VN5MR stylus work properly with the M97 body."}
{"prompt":"I am about to buy an the SM58 but I need a good recommendation of what to plug it into. Would a regular electric guitar amp work, or would I need a different kind of amp? If so, what would you recommend? Also, I have one other question. What advantages does the Beta 58A have over the SM58?","completion":"You would not be able to plug the SM58 directly into the normal input of a guitar amplifier, unless you added a Shure A95UF transformer to the end of the mic cable. This transforms the SM58 low impedance, balanced signal into a high impedance, unbalanced signal similar to a guitar signal.Our best suggestion, however, is to get a piece of equipment that has an XLR microphone input that will work perfectly fine with the SM58. The connector on the SM58 is called an XLR.The Beta 58A has a supercardioid pattern, the SM58 has a cardioid pattern. The Beta 58A has a hardened grill, the SM58 does not. The Beta 58A has a neodymium magnet for a little hotter output. The Beta 58A has a better internal shock mount. The Beta 58A has a little bit more extended high frequency response. The microphones are two different tools. Some people prefer the SM58, some people prefer the Beta 58A. It's all personal preference."}

{"prompt":"What type of battery should I use with my wireless microphone? Can I use a rechargeable battery with my wireless mic?","completion":"Batteries and Wireless MicrophonesBenjamin Franklin first coined the term \"battery\" during his famous electrical experiments. Then around 1800, Alessandro Volta, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Pavia, developed the first apparatus known to produce continuous electricity. Volta's name was later used to describe the potential of these cells: the volt.Since batteries are an expendable item, users are always trying to find cheaper, better alternatives. In the audio industry, wireless microphones are one of the top users of batteries. This article answers many of the common questions and explains how and why things operate the way they do.Battery ChemistryBatteries are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. They are composed of cells. Cells are composed of a cathode and an anode immersed in an electrolyte. The different types of cells, such as alkaline, Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH), all use these 3 components, but use different materials for the components. Batteries can be made up of a single cell or multiple cells.The different battery types produce different voltages per cell, depending on their chemical reactions. For instance, an alkaline battery produces 1.5 volts per cell, and Ni-Cd batteries produce 1.2 volts per cell. For a AA or AAA battery, just a single cell is used per battery. For a 9 volt battery, 6 alkaline cells are used, wired in series.Cells can be separated into two groups. Primary cells are one time use only, such as most alkalines and the old Zinc/Carbon type. Secondary cells are types that can be recharged, such as Ni-Cd, Ni-MH, and Lithium Ion (Li+). There are many more battery types, but this paper will only discuss the common ones applicable to wireless microphones.Battery CapacitiesThe most important specification for a battery is the capacity. The capacity is measured in mAh, i.e. current (specified in milli-amps) multiplied by time (specified in hours). If you know how much current a device takes to operate, it is possible to determine how long a battery will last.The table below gives typical capacities of popular AA batteries.Non-Rechargeable Type mAhAlkaline 1200Lithium 3000  Rechargeable Type mAhNi-Cd 600-1000Ni-MH 1700-2500The table below gives typical capacities of popular 9V batteries.Non-Rechargeable Type mAhAlkaline 500Lithium 1200Carbon Zinc 300  Rechargeable Type mAhLi+ 500Ni-Cd 120Ni-MH 150Note: The capacity of alkaline batteries changes with current draw, thus you might see other sources with a different capacity for alkaline batteries. The capacity listed above is for the typical current draw of a wireless microphone transmitter.Rechargeable BatteriesMany people want to use rechargeable batteries with wireless systems. Rechargeable AA batteries tend to work quite well in wireless microphones.However, there are downsides to using certain types of rechargeable 9 volt batteries.The first problem is the low capacity of Ni-Cd and Ni-MH 9 volt batteries. Ni-Cd and Ni-MH 9 volt batteries will last 1/4 of the time that an alkaline battery would. So, if your wireless bodypack lasts 8 hours with an alkaline battery, it would only last 2 hours with a Ni-Cd or Ni-MH 9 volt rechargeable battery.The second problem is the voltage or rechargeable 9 volt batteries. Unfortunately, although batteries are packaged in the \"9 V\" size, they may not have a potential of 9 volts. Obviously, batteries that are the \"9 V\" size contain multiple cells. Since alkaline cells are 1.5 V, it takes 6 cells to make one 9 V battery. Six Ni-Cd cells (1.2 V per cell), though, are only 7.2 V. It is possible to get a \"9 V\" sized Ni-Cd with 7 or 8 cells to make 8.4 or 9.6 V respectively. This shows that when looking at batteries, attention must be paid to their actual voltage, not just their physical appearance. Wireless transmitters like to see 9 V, so the 7.2 V rechargeables are generally not acceptable. Also, the 9.6 volts of an 8 cell battery can be too much for a wireless transmitters.The latest secondary cell is the rechargeable alkaline. The rechargeable alkaline is a good choice for a rechargeable battery. Unfortunately, no 9 volt version is available yet. While its initial capacity is within 10 percent of a standard alkaline, the discharge capacity fades with each cycle, with the majority of the fade occurring in early cycles.The best choice for a rechargeable 9 volt battery is the Lithium Ion. This type or rechargeable battery has a similar capacity and discharge when compared to the alkaline.AA rechargeable batteries can often have a larger capacity than their alkaline equivalent, making them an excellent choice. The Lithium non-rechargeable AA battery will last about twice as long as an alkaline for those events that need extended battery time.Charging Rechargeable BatteriesIf treated properly, secondary cells can be discharged and recharged hundreds of times and last many years. By far, the largest reason that rechargeable batteries fail to hold their charge is abuse. The largest cause of abuse is improper charging techniques. Books can and have been written about the charging techniques of secondary cells, so the information provided here will be an overview.Memory EffectFirst, the term \"memory effect\" needs to be addressed. Most people incorrectly use the term \"memory effect\". Memory effect is also synonymous with \"voltage depression.\" Memory effect is a temporary decrease in capacity. Note that it is temporary. The best explanation for voltage depression is from an article about Ni-Cd batteries by Ken Nishimura, University of California, Berkley.Let us define memory as the phenomenon where the discharge voltage for a given load is lower than it should be. This can give the appearance of a lowered capacity, while in reality, it is more accurate to term it voltage depression.Originally, memory effect was seen in spacecraft batteries subjected to a repeated discharge/charge cycle that was a fixed percentage of total capacity (due to the earth's shadow). After many cycles, when called upon to provide the full capacity, the battery failed to do so.Memory can be attributed to changes in the negative or cadmium plate. Recall that charging involves converting Cd(OH) to Cd metal. Ordinarily, and under moderate charging currents, the cadmium that is deposited is microcrystalline (i.e. very small crystals). Now, metallurgical thermodynamics states that grain boundaries (boundaries between the crystals) are high energy regions, and given time, the tendency of metals is for the grains to coalesce and form larger crystals. This is bad for the battery since it makes the cadmium harder to dissolve during high current discharge, and leads to high internal resistance and voltage depression.The trick to avoiding memory is avoiding forming large crystal cadmium. Very slow charging is bad, as slow growth aids large crystal growth. High temperatures are bad, since the nucleation and growth of crystals is exponentially driven by temperature. The problem is that given time, cadmium crystals will grow, and thus, the material needs to be reformed. Partial cycling of the cells means that the material deep within the plate never gets reformed. This leads to a growth of the crystals. By a proper execution of a discharge/charge cycle, the large crystal cadmium is destroyed and replaced with a microcrystalline form best for discharge.This does not mean that the battery needs to be cycled each time it is used. This does more harm than good, and unless it is done on a per cell basis, the cells risk being reversed and that really kills them. Perhaps once in a while, use the pack until it is 90% discharged, or to a cell voltage of 1.0 V under light load. Here, about 95% of the cells capacity is used, and for all intents and purposes, is discharged. At this point, recharge it properly, and that's it.The accompanying graph shows an experiment that Duracell performed on a Ni-MH cell. In cycle #1, the cell was discharged to 1.0 V then recharged. In cycles #2-#18, the cell was discharged to 1.15 V and then recharged. In the graph, it is apparent that cycle #18 had less capacity than cycles #1-#2. In cycles #19-#21, the cell was discharged completely to 1.0 V before recharging. The graph shows that after a couple full discharge/charge cycles, the cell returned to its normal capacity. This clearly shows that voltage depression is a temporary characteristic.Charging TechniquesBasically, there are two charging techniques: constant voltage and constant current. Lead acid batteries use constant voltage sources. Ni-Cd and Ni-MH use constant current sources. Li Ion use constant current for most of the charge and then switch to constant voltage for the last period. Li Ion is by far the pickiest about its charging. This means that manufacturers must take more care when developing the batteries and chargers. Ironically, this makes the Li Ion batteries harder to abuse because the batteries and chargers are more intelligent. The main criteria for effective charging are choosing the appropriate rate, limiting the temperature, and selecting the appropriate termination technique. If a secondary cell does not last for hundreds of discharge-charge cycles and many years, it was most likely abused in charging. Overcharging is where the most damage is done to the battery.There are many ways to determine when to stop charging a cell. Depending on the charge rate and type of battery, different termination techniques are used. Many times, multiple techniques are employed to guarantee proper charge termination. Common methods include (1) Timed Charge: charge the cell using low current over a set amount of time. (2) Voltage Drop: When a Ni-Cd cell is near full charge it rises sharply in voltage and then drops in voltage. The charging circuit detects this drop and stops the charge. (3) Voltage Plateau: Ni-MH does not have a very pronounced voltage drop, so instead the circuit detects the leveling off of the voltage upon full charge. (4) Temperature Cutoff: as the cell reaches full charge its temperature increases dramatically. The charging circuit terminates when the temperature of the cell reaches about 140F. (5) Delta Temperature Cutoff: measures the difference in temperature from start to end. The circuit would stop charging when the temperature is about 27F higher than the start temperature. This minimizes ambient temperature problems that the standard temperature cutoff exhibits. (6) Rate of Temperature Increase: measures how fast the temperature increases. If fast charging, the charger will stop when the rate of increase is about 1.8F per minute. This also helps minimize ambient temperature effects. Note that some of these termination methods are better for Ni-Cd cells and some are better for Ni-MH cells. For more information, see Duracell's paper on Ni-MH batteries available on their web site.The life of a secondary cell can easily be up to 500 cycles. If a battery does not hold a charge after 50 or so cycles, it is not because of memory effect. It is because of a breakdown of some component of the battery, usually caused by abuse. Operation or storage at extreme temperatures, overcharging, cell venting and abusive use will reduce battery life. When a cell is overcharged excessively, exposed to extreme high temperatures, or otherwise abused, gas builds up in the cell. This excess pressure is released through a safety vent that is designed into the cell. Heat and overcharging are a rechargeable battery's worst enemies.Battery Physical SizeBesides different voltages in batteries, batteries can also have different physical dimensions. This is true of both AA and 9 volt batteries. The dimensions of batteries can easily vary by over 1/16\". While that may not sound like much, 1/16\" can be a 13% change in the dimension of the battery. To the mechanical engineer that is designing the battery compartment, it makes a world of difference. Typically, the rechargeables are larger. There have been instances where battery compartments were too small to fit the larger batteries.Battery DischargeOf course every wireless transmitter will have a different battery life depending on the current draw of the circuit. There is one difference in circuit design, though, that can largely effect battery life: crystal controlled vs. frequency synthesized. Crystal controlled and frequency synthesized are the two circuit types that are used to create an RF frequencyCrystal controlledThe circuit design for a crystal controlled system is fairly simple and uses a minimum amount of components. This design is fairly efficient in operation so battery life can be quite long. The disadvantage to this method is that the system is limited to a single frequency.Frequency SynthesizedFrequency synthesis circuits can produce many frequencies from a single reference crystal, allowing for multiple operating frequencies. Since the frequency synthesis circuit is more complex, the components used draw more current and therefore shorten the battery life of the transmitter.As electrical component manufacturers develop more efficient components, the battery life of these two circuit designs will grow closer together. The graph shows a crystal controlled UT transmitter versus a frequency synthesized UC system, both 9 volt powered transmitters.Which Battery to UseMany times the Applications Engineering Department at Shure is asked for battery recommendations. The accompanying graph of a UT transmitter helps summarize the performance of different 9 volt batteries with wireless microphones.The first battery on the graph is an alkaline type. The 9 volt alkaline battery is the best battery for the job. It provides very good performance time along with decent voltage levels for a minimal amount of money. Alkaline batteries are the recommended choice for nearly all wireless systems and applications. There are other batteries, such as Lithium, that will last longer, but cost much more.The second battery on the graph is an 8.4 volt version of a Ni-MH battery. During its usable life, the voltage of the 8.4 battery tracks the alkaline quite well. An 8.4 volt version of a Ni-Cd would die out about 10-30 minutes before the Ni-MH did.The third battery shown is a 7.2 volt version of the Ni-Cd. Whether Ni-Cd or Ni-MH, 7.2 volt batteries do not have adequate performance to provide the proper voltage for the wireless transmitter. Batteries that are only 7.2 volt are not recommended for wireless systems.ConclusionBy knowing the current draw of the wireless transmitter along with the capacity of the battery, it is possible to know the life of the battery. Wireless transmitters that use AA batteries, rechargeables and alkalines both perform well. For older transmitters that use 9 volt batteries, it is easy to show that rechargeable 9 volt Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries have a much shorter life than standard alkaline types. For this reason, 9 volt Ni-Cd and Ni-MH rechargeables are typically not well suited for wireless transmitter applications. Therefore, 9 volt alkaline batteries are the best choice because of their performance for the cost. If an application does require rechargeable batteries, use the 9 volt version of the rechargeable Li+ batteries.Until someone finishes Nikola Tesla's experiments on wireless electricity, batteries will be a major part of our lives. Learning how to properly choose and use these batteries will make the experience as pleasant as possible.Common alkaline batteries are Duracell, Energizer, etc.Most drug store brand batteries are zinc-carbon. Zinc-carbon batteries are also labeled under Ever-Ready, Ray-O-Vac or most batteries that claim to be \"Heavy-Duty\"."}

In addition to frequency, these government agencies typically specify other aspects of the equipment itself, including transmitter power, modulation type, spurious emissions, and other parameters. These specifications differ from one band to another and from one user to another within a given band. For these reasons, it is not possible to select a specific frequency or frequency band that is legally usable in all parts of the world.Use of the radio frequency bands in the United States is regulated by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Certain frequencies within each band have been designated for use by wireless microphones as well as by other services. In the United States, the frequencies used for these systems may be grouped into general bands or ranges:Low-band VHF (49-108 MHz)High-band VHF (174-216 MHz)Low-band UHF (450-616 MHz)900 MHz (902-928 MHz and 940-960 MHz)UPCS/DECT (1920-1930 MHz)2.4 GHz (2400-2480 MHz)5 GHz (5000-6000 MHz)The FCC also determines who can operate in each band and who has priority if more than one user is operating. Primary users include licensed radio/television broadcasters and commercial communications services such as 2-way radio, pagers, and mobile phones. Wireless microphone system users are always considered to be secondary users. In general, priority is given to primary users. Secondary users may not interfere with primary users, but secondary users may be subject to interference from primary users.Please note that while manufacturers must be licensed by the FCC to sell wireless equipment, it is the responsibility of the wireless microphone system operator to observe FCC regulations regarding its actual use.Described below are the VHF and UHF radio frequency bands. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages for wireless microphone operation, based on the designated users of the band, the physical characteristics of the band, and the regulatory limitations of the band.VHFAt the beginning of the low-band VHF range is the 49 MHz region. This region is used not only by inexpensive wireless microphones, but also by some cordless telephones, walkie-talkies, and radio controlled toys. The 54-72 MHz region is occupied by VHF television channels 2 - 4. The 72 MHz area is used by \"assistive listening\" type wireless systems. 76 - 88 MHz are assigned to VHF television channels 5 and 6. At the top of the low band VHF range, 88 - 108 MHz is the commercial FM radio broadcast band. All of these regions have been used at one time or another for wireless microphone systems. Allowable deviation limits (typically up to 15kHz) can accommodate high-fidelity audio. This is the same deviation as for FM radio broadcast. The propagation of these RF waves through the air is very good, as is their ability to pass through many non-metallic substances. This is a result of the relatively long wavelength which ranges from 9 feet to 20 feet. The most attractive feature of operation in the low-band VHF range is low equipment cost.Except for assistive listening systems, low-band VHF is not recommended for serious applications. Due to the large number of primary and secondary users, plus high levels of general radio frequency (RF) \"noise,\" this band is prone to interference from many sources. Transmitter power is limited to less than 50 mW, except in the 72-76 MHz range where up to 1 watt is allowed for assistive listening systems. Finally, the minimum proper antenna size for units in this range can be over three feet long (1/4 wavelength), which can severely limit portability and/or efficiency.The high-band VHF range is used for professional audio applications, and quality wireless microphone systems are available for sale. In the U.S., the high-band VHF range is 174 - 216 MHz. The primary users of this band are VHF television channels 7 - 13. Each occupies 6 MHz of bandwidth: channel 7 (174 - 180 MHz); channel 8 (180 - 186 MHz), etc. High quality audio is possible using digital modulation, and 1/4 wavelength antenna sizes range down to less than 14 inches.The possibility of interference from other secondary users and general RF noise exists, especially from Ethernet networks which operate up to approximately 350 MHz. In addition, this range includes the primary users of television channels 7 - 13. In some other countries, the high-band VHF range extends to 230 MHz. This band is generally not recommended for new wireless microphone installations, except in specific circumstances. Contact Shure Applications Engineering for more information on when to specify VHF systems.UHFLike the VHF region, the UHF region contains several bands that are used for wireless microphone systems. However, certain physical, regulatory, and economic differences between VHF and UHF regions should be noted here. The primary physical characteristic of UHF radio waves is their much shorter wavelength of 12 inches to 24 inches. The most apparent consequence of this is the much shorter length of antennas for UHF wireless microphone systems. One less obvious consequence is slightly reduced radio wave propagation both through the air and through other non-metallic materials, such as walls and human bodies. However, more efficient antenna designs usually overcome this issue. Another consequence is the increased amount of radio wave reflections by smaller metal objects, resulting in comparatively more frequent and more severe interference due to multi-path (dropouts). However, diversity receivers are very effective in the UHF band and the required antenna spacing is minimal.While the regulations for users and for licensing are essentially the same in the VHF and UHF bands, regulations for the equipment allow two potential differences. For FM signals in the UHF band, greater occupied bandwidth is allowed. This effectively permits greater deviation for potentially wider frequency range and wider dynamic range of the audio signal. In addition, transmitter power up to 250 mW is allowed. Finally, the available radio spectrum for UHF wireless microphone system use is significantly larger than for high-band VHF. This allows for a much larger number of wireless microphone systems to be operated simultaneously. The capability for an increased number of simultaneous systems is a significant benefit.The low-band UHF range of frequencies may be considered as two overlapping bands: low (450-536 MHz) and high (470-616 MHz). The primary users of these bands are business services such as land mobile radio and pagers (450-536 MHz), and UHF television channels 14 - 36 (470-608 MHz). Above 608 MHz, there exists a 6 MHz Radio Astronomy observation band, and then a 2 MHz wide guard band before the 600 MHz cellular bands begin at 616 MHz. As in the high-band VHF region, unused television channels are allotted for wireless microphone system use. Business and television are the primary users in the low part of this band, but interference from primary users is rare in the high (non-business) part of the band aside from UHF television stations. Other secondary users and RF noise are also less likely at these frequencies than at VHF.The required minimum 1/4 wavelength antenna size for UHF radio waves is 4 - 7 inches. Equipment is reasonably priced, diversity systems are standard to minimize dropouts, and high quality audio can be achieved along with a large number of simultaneous systems.The high-band UHF range, above 900 MHz, includes both the license-free ISM band from 902-298 MHz, and licensed studio-to-transmitter link (STL) band from 940-960 MHz. The ISM band is useful for small channel count systems, and may be used nationwide—but interference from smart utility meters may limit the usefulness of this band. The STL band offers additional channels and potentially less interference from RF noise, as well as antenna lengths of only 3 or 4 inches, but a license is required for all users. Other operating characteristics are similar to low-band UHF. It should be noted that the allocation of these bands is always subject to governmental change as demand for spectrum increases.This, along with other information about how wireless microphones work, can be found in our online publication Selection and Operation of Wireless Microphone Systems."}
{"prompt":"I was thinking about switching the head on my wireless from an SM58 to a Beta 87A. Since the wired version of this mic uses phantom power, what powers the wireless version. In other words. Will it eat batteries faster?","completion":"The Beta 87A wireless cartridge will not increase the battery drain. The interchangable mic capsules in the Shure wireless line all draw the same battery current....that is why they are interchangable!"}
{"prompt":"I'm working on a project that involves cutting down wind noise for cyclists. As microphones use a windscreen to effectively do the same thing I thought it may also be appropriate to use the same material. The question is, what is the material? Is it just a polyurethane? Are there different ratings? Are there any that use a cloth instead of a foam? Where can I get any samples of this sort of thing?","completion":"The material is open cell foam. There are ratings are based on the the \"open-ness\" of the foam. The concept is to surround the microphone with still air, instead of turbulent air. The effectiveness of any windscreen is a direct function of its diameter, i.e., bigger is better.We suggest you contact a windscreen company for more assistance."}
{"prompt":"I have a mid 80's vintage V15V cartridge which I tried to use recently and it apparently has suffered \"stylus bushing\" failure, as it will not track anything and the cantilever won't even budge. I know the ADC turntable is fine, because it works flawlessly with the ADC XLM cartridge that originally came with it before I \"upgraded\" to the V15V. Your recommended replacement stylus VN5MR is pretty pricey for the rare times I expect to play records.Will any of your cheaper replacement stylus work in my V15V with satisfactory results?Will a new Shure replacement stylus have the rubber bushing deteriorate and seize up over time like my V15V stylus did?","completion":"Sorry, but no. Only the VN5MR will work properly with your cartridge.All cartridges use rubber bushings which are eventually attacked by the ozone in the atmosphere. It is the same as tire rot.Sorry, Shure no longer has inventory of the VN5MR stylus."}
{"prompt":"I have a wireless Beta 58 and have had it for about 6 months. Several sound engineers have told me that the capsule is not correct for my voice. They say it is accentuating the range I am already strong in and that I need a capsule that will give me more clarity and boost in the mid to lower ranges. Is the Beta 58 incorrect for my voice or could there be something wrong with my capsule? What capsule would you suggest for a 1st tenor?","completion":"Microphone selection is completely personal preference. It's similar to asking, \"Which is the correct color, red or green?\" Some people like the color red, and some people like the color green.Visit your local Shure dealer and try the different microphones to determine which microphone you like best. It will help to record your voice with the different microphones, so that you can listen to each while you are not singing."}
{"prompt":"Just purchased a wireless microphone system. I am using this system in a House of Worship with the receiver being in a fixed position. Will it damage the receiver to leave it powered up all the time?","completion":"It is perfectly fine to leave the receiver on all the time. It will not damage it."}
{"prompt":"I have a Dual 1218 turntable (circa 1973). It has a Shure M91ED cartridge. I'd like to get a new stylus for it so I can play my records and hopefully transfer them to digital. Do you still make them?","completion":"The N91ED stylus is no longer available."}
{"prompt":"Is it be possible to build a battery power source for the SCM268? If so, do you have any resources for researching such a project or is someone out there already building such devices?","completion":"The SCM268 has an internal power supply and thus cannot be easily battery powered. In order to battery power it, you would need a large 12 volt battery, along with an external inverter (to convert the 12Vdc to 120Vac). The mixer could then plug into this inverter.For batteries, something as simple as a car battery will work. "}
{"prompt":"I have two questions regarding Computer / Soundcard microphone inputs:On some computers the electret bias source is actually wired together with the \"tip\" signal inside the computer. This is done to be able to handle electret microphones with mono jacks (no separate tip and ring). I have seen some Taiwan PC motherboard companies do this. What happens if a dynamic microphone is used on this jack and the bias current flows through the MIC voice coil? Does it affect the microphone performance? Or, because the bias is a DC current it has no effect? I realize that a dynamic mic is less sensitive and will require an internal preamp (and the signal will face the 2K impedance of the mic bias resistor), but will it still produce it's normal AC audio signal into the jack with the bias current present?What is the typical output impedance of an electret microphone (at the tip, AC wise)?Follow up questionsThanks for your quick response. You do raise some interesting points.The bias current under the conditions that I described is about 1 to 3 mA, will this be enough to damage or upset the dynamic microphone?Do the professional dynamic microphones actually have a built-in preamp? Are they powered by batteries?","completion":"  It does effect the microphone and could damage the microphone. The bias voltage should be blocked by a capacitor. It will still produce an AC audio signal with the bias present, assuming the current from the bias doesn't burn up and destroy the voice coil. It could very well sound funny though. With DC current running through the coil, the coil will no longer be centered in the magnetic field.It depends on where you are measuring it. Directly off the element, the impedance is usually in the megaohm range. Within one inch of the element, there will be a JFET. The output of the JFET has an impedance of 1-2kohm. A professional microphone will then have a another set of electronics that lower the impedance even further to 150-300 ohms.We do not have the specifications on how much current would heat up the voice coil enough to fry it. No. Professional dynamic microphones do not have a built-in preamp."}
{"prompt":"Would splitting the output of a wireless receiver (in Mic output mode) to two independent mixers give me any problems like a crackling, overdriven noise on one of the systems?","completion":"No, there shouldn't be any problem with the splitting the audio output of a wireless receiver to 2 different mixers."}
{"prompt":"I am involved with a theatre group that is planning to do a production of 42nd Street. We were wondering if there are microphones or accessories that could be used to reinforce the sound of the tap dancing. Are there floor microphones that accomplish this?","completion":"Productions like \"Stomp\" attach a small mic near the feet of the dancer. Each dancer wears a wireless transmitter to send the mic signal to the sound booth. With this expensive setup, the mic moves with the performer and so the tap sound is always consistent.Example of Shure product for this approach: ULX-D & DL4They also prerecord the sound of the \"tap\", to be played back in synch with the music during the performance. Essentially, this is the equivalent of lip synching.Placing stationary mics, like the Shure MX391, at the front of the stage is much less expensive. However, the amount of sound picked up is a function of how close the dancer is to the mic."}

{"prompt":"How do I connect my Motiv microphone to a computer?","completion":"Most Motiv microphones can be used with a Mac or PC.The MVi, MV5, MV51, and MV88+ can connect to any Mac or PC with a standard USB Micro to USB A cable. No drivers are required. The USB standard supports cable lengths up to 15 feet. When connecting to a Windows 10 PC, you may need to adjust the default sample rate. See Why is the audio pitch shifted to lower frequency on my Motiv mic? for more information.The MVL lavalier microphone should work any any computer equipped with a standard TRRS connector like those found on iPhone and Android devices.The MV88 only works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices with a native lightning port. It does not work with computers or devices with a USB-C connector, even with an adaptor cable."}
{"prompt":"I have encountered wired and wireless microphones, made by Shure, with the brand name ACCESS? Where these made for the Guitar Center chain of stores?","completion":"Yes, the ACCESS line was fabricated for Guitar Center. In the late 1990's and early 2000's, Shure offered a line of wired and wireless microphones specifically for the Guitar Center Chain. Below is a list of the ACCESS model numbers and the corresponding Shure model.Wired MicrophonesAXS1 - Shure 33-984E (dynamic)AXS2 - Shure BG 1.1 (dynamic)AXS3 - Shure BG 2.1 (dynamic)AXS4 - Shure BG 4.1 (condenser)AXS5 - Shure BG 5.1 (condenser)AXS6 - Shure BG 6.1 (dynamic)Wireless MicrophonesAXB1 - Shure T1 bodypack transmitterAXB1G - Shure T1G bodypack transmitterAXH2/58 - Shure T2/58 handheld transmitterAXH2/31 - Shure T2/31 handheld transmitterAXR3 - Shure T3 non-divesity receiverAXR4G - Shure T4G diversity receiverAXR4V - Shure T4V diversity receiverAXU1 - Shure UT 1 bodypack transmitterAXU2/58 - Shure UT2/58 handheld transmitterAXUR4 - Shure UT4 diversity receiver"}
{"prompt":"I am going to install some home automation which will be controlled via voice recognition hopefully via some good microphones mounted in key rooms, I have heard that some users are using the SM11 mic. Can you recommend the correct microphone for this type of application? The smaller the better.","completion":"We suggest the MX180 series or MX300 series. These mics require phantom power from the mic mixer or the mic preamplifier.What is Phantom Power?"}
{"prompt":"I'm a hypnotist. I need a reasonably priced hand held wireless mic for stage shows I host & for corporate programs I host that will not pick up police & other radio frequencies. I'm just about ready to buy one of yours. Any input?","completion":"Look at the SLX-D series or BLX series."}
{"prompt":"What is the range of tracking force for the V15VxMR without the dynamic stabilizer? I know that optimum is 1.0 grams. Would 1.25 grams would be excessive?","completion":"The tracking force range is 0.75 grams to 1.25 grams.If the stabilizer is in use, add 0.5 grams to the tracking force setting. This is because the upward force of the stabilizer decreases the tracking force by 0.5 grams."}
{"prompt":"Where can I find the Access AXS58D-CL on your web site?","completion":"The User Guide can be found at:http://pubs.shure.com/guide/UHF/en-US"}
{"prompt":"Can I use the \"plug-in-power\" capabilities of my camcorder to power the Shure SM93 lapel microphone?","completion":"No. What Sony calls \"plug-in-power\" is actually Bias Voltage. The SM93 requires Phantom Power. You will need a phantom power supply. We recommend the Phantom Power adapter for camcorders made by Beachtek."}
{"prompt":"Is the KSM32 a true capacitor mic or an electret? Is it sealed from the factory with a built in charge or is it an externally polarized design? Does the mic have a limited life as do other electret or backplate designs?","completion":"The KSM32 is an electret design.The KSM44 and KSM27 are an external polarized design (\"true condenser\").Well-designed electrets no longer have limited life spans like the original electrets from the 1970s."}
{"prompt":"As a singer, it's a year now that I've got a PSM system and I find them REEAALLY GOOD. The only one problem is that I can't hear the audience after a song. I tried to use only one earphone in a ear, and it works, but obviously I would like to use them both. What can I do? ","completion":"Many users of in-ear monitors add an \"audience ambience\" mic to the PSM mix. This is mic hung over the audience and its signal is added only to the mix that feeds the PSM. A typical mic for this application is the Shure SM63."}
{"prompt":"I want to take my mixer and a tape deck into the field to record nature sounds for \"ambience\" CD's. I'll be taping lake surf, rainstorms, birds, crickets and other low-sound-pressure sources. I'm in the market for an appropriate mic.I tried a friend's PGA81 and really liked it. Do you have any other suggestions? I think a pair of mics would be preferable to a stereo mic, but would like to know if Shure makes a model that is particularly suited to this sort of environment.","completion":"In addition to the PGA81, we also suggest the SM137, KSM141, or VP88. The VP88 is a stereo microphone."}
{"prompt":"Do you have a microphone suitable for use with a cajon, preferably internally (percussion box used in flamenco)?","completion":"Assuming there is not much room inside, try the Beta 98. It is a small mic designed for miking drums at a very close distance.The mic requires phantom power; make certain your audio mixer has it."}
{"prompt":"I am interested in the 55SH Series II Microphone. I need to know a couple of things before I decide to buy it. What kind of floor mic stand does it need? Also, what kind of mic cord does it need?","completion":"Mic floor stand is Shure MS10C. Mic cable is Shure C25J (25 feet with an XLR connector on both ends.)"}
{"prompt":"I have a camcorder. Can I use the SM93 microphone with this kind of camera? I don´t know if I need phantom voltage to power it (this camera hasn´t got...) . if so, how can I give energy to the mic? ","completion":"You will need an interface such as the Beachtek interfaces.The SM93 requires phantom power. The interface is necessary to supply the phantom power."}
{"prompt":"My wife has a very powerful voice and it seems to overdrive the mic. Even compression isn't helping. We have a good mix all night long, but people complain about her loud, high notes. Is there a mic that is better for a very powerful singer?","completion":"For really strong singers, we recommend a dynamic mic, like the Beta 58 or SM58. A properly designed dynamic mic cannot be overdriven, except maybe by a Saturn V rocket.Condensor mics have internal electronics and these can be overloaded by a very strong singer.But a dynamic mic can produce such a strong signal that the signal will cause distortion at the input of the mixer. Learn to properly use the \"Input Attenuation\" control (also called \"Input Trim\" or \"Input Pad\") on your mic mixer. If your mixer does not have such a control, that could be your problem, not the microphone."}
{"prompt":"I'm a production guy at a local radio station want to record sfx and atmosphere/ambience for my creative work. Some of the field recording articles I've read mention using a stereo pair for such ventures. My question is: A pair of what type of mic?","completion":"What we recommend is a condenser microphone that has a flat frequency response, like the SM137, SM81 or KSM141."}
{"prompt":"Can I convert a Beta 58A microphone to be wireless?","completion":"A wired Beta 58A can only be made wireless by connecting it to one of our bodypacks using the WA310 cable.There is no way to modify a wired Beta 58A to make it a wireless handheld microphone.Most of our wireless systems are available with the wireless version of the Beta 58A cartridge."}
{"prompt":"Is it possible to order a replacement wind screen for a Shure model SM58 wired microphone?","completion":"The part you are looking for is a replacement grill, model RK143G. The foam insert is not sold separately."}
{"prompt":"Should the WBH53 Microphone work ok with a wireless transmitter? I have just purchased the microphone to replace a broken WCM16. It sounds very weak, poor sound.","completion":"Yes, the WBH53 should work. But it will sound very different than the WCM16. The WCM16 is a hypercardioid mic and will have more bass response.The WBH53 may be working properly, but you simply do not like the sound. Perhaps you should buy another WCM16."}
{"prompt":"What is the best way to mike a djembe? Do you use one or two mikes? What kind do you recommend, and how would you attach the mike(s) to the Dejembe for a live performance (assuming you are standing up, without a Djembe stand)?","completion":"A djembe is miked like other drums and percussion.For ideas on miking for live sound, and miking for recording, see the educational material at: Educational Articles - Online booklets and bulletinsOne mic is suggested. To see which microphones we recommend for various percussion instruments, see our online selection guide at: Selection GuidesAuditioning the different mics with your instrument is the best way to decide what mic fills your musical need.Attaching the mic to the drum is not recommended because the mechanical vibration of the drum will be transferred directly into the mic. But if this is what you want to do, contact the company Latin Percussion; they offer unique devices for mounting mics to percussion instruments."}
{"prompt":"I need to replace the wire for a 55SW microphone 55SW. This mic has a female plug at one end of the cord and a phono plug at the other. The female plug on the cord has three contacts it attach's to the mic and is held in place with a threaded ring. Would you have a part # for this cord so that I may order a new cord for my mike or the type or name of the female plug that is used so that I can make up a new cord?","completion":"The 55SW needs an Amphenol MC3M on the cable. We do not carry these connectors.You can get pre-wired cables from Tom Ellis (214-328-3225)."}
{"prompt":"I require a pair of microphones to record a saxophone quartet in stereo. What do you recommend for a choice of microphones and location/setup of the microphones?","completion":"For a complete listing of microphones that we recommend for ensembles, see our online Selection Guides.You should use the microphones in an X-Y configuration. The best placement will probably be for the quartet to form a semi circle around the microphones. Experiment to see what sound you like. You can also find other mic placement recommendations as well as stereo microphone techniques in our online publication \"Microphone Techniques for Music - Studio Recording\" at Shure Technical Publications."}
{"prompt":"We have a requirement for a microphone in a theme park application, the microphone could be located up to 100 metres from the equipment rack. Cable would be industrial type pulled through underground ducts. Because of the distance, the type of cable and the amount of electrical noise around the rides I would prefer to run the audio at line level to reduce risk of interference. Is the 527C suitable for this application (remote powered with dc voltage from the rack) or should I be looking at the 527B with a separate pre-amplifier.. or do you have any other suggestions?","completion":"The 527C would be a good choice IF the output was balanced, but it is not. Plus the maximum recommended cable length is 30 meters, not 100 meters. (We assume the mic input at the rack will be balanced, preferably transformer balanced. If not, it should be.)We recommend the 527B and a separate preamp with a balanced output. Look at the preamps available from: https://www.rdlnet.com/Most of their products operate from 24 Vdc. That fact may prove useful to your design."}
{"prompt":"Your manual includes the typical polar patterns for the MX392 series mics. However, I assume that these are patterns in the horizontal plane. What about the vertical plane? Since the mic is on a boundary, we only have 180 degrees to work with. Where would 0 degrees be? On the table boundary, or at the approx 60 degree angle the mic is facing?","completion":"Zero degrees is the table boundary, directly in front of the word \"PUSH\". If the MX392 is suspended in mid-air, the pattern looks like a standard mic, ignoring the minor effect of the MX392 bottom plate which is a small boundary itself. Placing the MX392 on a table surface essentially divides the polar pattern in half. The larger the table, the greater the boundary effect is at lower frequencies. Note that a 100 Hz acoustical signal is 11 feet long!If you use the MX392 supercardioid pattern, the optimal loudspeaker placement would be 120 degrees away from 0 degrees."}
{"prompt":"At one time, Shure furnished a stylus microscope to dealers. Do you still have any for sale in new/or used condition. In the alternative, can you advise if you have a dealer that has one they would sell?","completion":"We do not have inventory of the MKE-1 or MKE-2 stylus evaluation kits.The microscope that came with the stylus evaluation kits was a model M240, manufactured by Swift Instruments."}
{"prompt":"What is the replacement stylus for the Shure 3X needle?","completion":"The replacement stylus for the R3X is the N75EC."}
{"prompt":"I need an inline volume control knob for several microphones.1) XLR type low Z volume control jack that I can plug into an XLR microphone between the mic and the mic cable and 2) the old screw-on type Switchcraft type microphone connector (for old bullet mics like the Astatic JT-30 and Shure 520 green bullet) i.e. a screw on type volume control for hi Z mics to put between the mic and the mic cable so you control the volume (this is for harmonica playing).","completion":"You will have to build these yourself. Stand alone in-line volume controls for mic level signals are no longer manufactured.Two reasons:There is very little demand for such a device;It is difficult to find potentiometers that will not induce noise into the mic signal.The Shure 520DX has an internal volume control. Copy this circuit to build a control for high impedance mics. The value of the pot should be 100,000 ohms.The same type of circuit can be used for a low impedance control. The value of the pot should be 2,000 ohms."}
{"prompt":"I was told that Shure made a mic that is worn like the WH20, but instead of the mic mounted on the side of the head, it actually comes over the top of the head. What model is this?","completion":"The SM10A band goes over the top of the head. The mic itself is mounted at the side of the head. The boom arm is rigid but is adjustable via a thumbscrew. The SM10A was discontinued in 2019."}
{"prompt":"I just bought an M44-7 and whenever I play a certain record it would leave white particles where ever the needle was just on. Is there any thing wrong with my needles or is it just my tonearm height and tonearm weight? Tonearm Height: 4; Tonearm Weight: 3","completion":"We have never heard of this problem. There may be a problem with the vinyl used to make that \"certain record\".To help better understand turntable setup, please see: Stylus break-in"}
{"prompt":"What do you recommend for a wireless mic for a violin?","completion":"Put the mic on the violinist, not the violin. Experiment with positioning.Try the WL93 mic or the MX150B/O-TQG mic. Both are available with the proper connector to mate with a Shure transmitter that has a TQG connector."}
{"prompt":"Why is it that the specifications for the model 16AM specify a maximum SPL of 120dB where as other microphones I might use for acoustic instruments such as the venerable SM57 have no such limit specified?","completion":"The model 16AM is a condenser. A condenser mic has an internal electronic preamp that has a distortion point. Less expensive mics have less expensive preamps with lower clipping points. The model 16AM is an example. The higher quality Shure KSM141 condenser mic has a limit of 164 dB SPL!A dynamic mic has no electronics and its SPL limit is a physical limitation: the point where the diaphragm hits the magnet and can move no further. Even with very inexpensive models, this limit tends to be over 180 dB SPL, that is like the sound level of a Saturn V rocket at 5 feet.Mic test chambers cannot create such high levels. Therefore, the SPL limit of a dynamic mic is typically an estimate.Also, read the following: Can a dynamic microphone handle really loud sounds? (Maximum SPL)"}

{"prompt":"I recently purchased a SM58 microphone. So far, I have not been able to achieve noticeable volume levels when using the mic with my Peavey Mixer amp. When I was sold this mic, I was assured that I would be able to properly use it straight into the mixer amp, without a mic preamp or transformer. If this is not the case, please let me know. When I max out ALL the values on the mixer amp, I can barely, but just barely, hear my voice from the monitors/speakers. When I plug one of my old $50 mics into the same input jack, it nearly blows my monitors. I have also tried using different input jacks, and different cables, yet nothing so far has worked past the point described above. Any help on the subject would be GREATLY appreciated. I am very disappointing, and would like to resolve this problem as soon as possible. Also, if the problem IS that I need a transformer or preamp, can you please let me know of a microphone in the same price range that will not require a transformer / preamp, or a microphone that is near to the quality of the SM58 and a transformer/preamp that would add up approximately to the same price as the SM58. What can you recommend?","completion":"The input on your Peavey likely requires a high impedance microphone. Is the input connector a 1/4\" female phone jack? If so, it is very likely a high impedance input.The SM58 is a low impedance microphone. All professional mics are low impedance.Placing a low impedance to high impedance transformer at the equipment end of the mic cable is the best solution. The transformer steps up the SM58 signal output to satisfy the high impedance input of the Peavey. Consider the Shure A85F or A95UF transformer.We do not recommend exchanging the SM58 for a high impedance mic. In general, high impedance mics are of lesser quality than low impedance mics. Keep the SM58 and add a transformer."}

{"prompt":"I play drums in an alternative rock band and own a hardwired PSM600 system with an E5 earphone. I usually set up the volume of my receiver at 12 o´clock (or 5 volume level) and let the monitor engineer bring the different sound sources up during soundcheck (drums, bass, guitars, keys and vocals) until they are at a comfortable listening level. An outside engineer recommended i set up my receiver level at around 2 o´clock (7 volume level) to avoid having the signals on the monitor board become \"too hot\", and thus prevent any sort of distortion in my ear monitors. What volume level on my receiver should i aim for? 5? 7? 10??? I had originally decided to set it up at 5 to have a clear visual reference in order to turn it down (in case the overall volume of the band is too high) or turn it up (in case the overall volume of the band is too low). What's best?","completion":"Actually, there are a couple things you can do to prevent distortion, which are unrelated to the setting of your volume control.If the monitor engineer sends a signal that it too \"hot\" to your P6HW, the input will distort before the earphones do. If you begin to hear distortion because of the monitor send, open up the battery compartment and flip switch number 1 into the \"Up\" position. This will engage a 15 dB pad at the input. This should be enough attenuation to prevent the monitor signal from causing distortion. You will probably need to increase the volume control to compensate for the reduced input signal.Make sure the limiter is turned on (switch 4). The limiter will prevent excessively loud sounds from damaging your ear drums. Chances are, you would be damaging your hearing long before you could pump enough signal into the E5 to cause distortion. The limiter not only protects your hearing, but should prevent the output stage of the P6HW from distorting the E5s.Remember that increasing the volume control of the P6HW does not increase headroom, it only increases background noise. Additionally, if the signal is distorting at the input of the P6HW, putting the volume control at 2 o'clock will only make the distortion louder - use the input pad."}
{"prompt":"Why does a balance line provide a better quality sound?","completion":"The balanced line does not provide better audio quality. It is simply better at rejecting unwanted noise and interference than an unbalanced line. Thus, the audio signal is typically cleaner when using a balanced source, balanced cable, and balanced load.See also: Difference between balanced and unbalanced"}

{"prompt":"I want to use multiple ULX receivers with a passive antenna splitter. Is there anything special that needs to be done?","completion":"NOTE: This modification is no longer needed when using the UA221. The UA221 includes an internal capacitor to block the DC voltage traveling from one receiver to the other.When the antenna inputs for ULX receivers are combined using a passive splitter such as the UA220, the DC voltage on the antenna inputs must be disabled for all receivers, except one. That is, if the UA220 is being used, the voltage must be disabled on one of the receivers. If a 4-way passive combiner is being used, the DC voltage must be disabled on at least three of the receivers, in some cases, on all four receivers. It depends upon the internal design of the passive spiltter. Follow these instructions to disable the DC voltage.Remove the 4 screws on the corners of the front panel. Remove the 4 screws on the corners of the rear panel.Gently pull at the front and rear panels. Once the front panel is loose, disconnect the ribbon cable from the front panel. It is just friction fit, so grab near the blue portion of the ribbon and pull.Once the rear panel is loose, use a screw driver to disconnect the connector that has two white wires going to it. Slide the rear panel with the PC board attached out of the housing. Locate the two components near the antenna inputs. They will have purple colored band around them. Remove these two components using a soldering iron. It may be useful to grab the components with a tweezers while you apply heat with the soldering iron.

{"prompt":"What are explanations of stylus shapes and terms?","completion":"Spherical StylusThe typical Shure spherical stylus tip has a radius of 0.7 mil.Positive attribute: less tip wear due to a larger surface area contacting the record.Negative attribute: high frequency response will be rolled-off as the \"large\" radius of the tip will not trace the \"small\" grooves containing the highest frequencies.Biradial StylusThe typical Shure biradial stylus tip has radii of 0.4 x 0.7 mil or 0.2 x 0.7 mil.Note: The term \"biradial\" describes the stylus tip shape more accurately than the more commonly used term \"elliptical\".Positive attribute: better high frequency response than a spherical due to the smaller contact radii of the stylus tip.Negative attribute: slightly faster tip wear than a spherical due to the decreased tip/groove contact area.Elliptical StylusSee Biradial above.Hyperelliptical StylusPositive attribute: longer tip life than a biradial.Negative attribute: difficult to manufacture and therefore expensive.If a cartridge requires a hyperelliptical stylus tip (a tip shape no longer offered by Shure), substitute a biradial stylus with 0.2 x 0.7 mil tip.Micro-RidgeThe Micro-Ridge is the most advanced tip shape available. It is based on a hyperelliptical design but has additional shaping to the tip to create the \"Micro-Ridge\".Positive attribute: lowest tip wear of any tip shape AND the best high frequency response.Negative attribute: very difficult to manufacture and therefore very expensive.Stylus for 78 RPM recordsThe groove of a 78 RPM record is much wider than the groove of a 33 1/3 RPM record, so a larger stylus tip is required. The tip radius should be 2.0 mils or larger. The tip shape should be spherical.If a 0.7 mil spherical stylus tip is employed, it will ride very low in the groove and may even ride on the bottom of the groove.

{"prompt":"I am having a problem with a M44G on a Numark Pro-TT2. The needle gets stuck at the end of some records usually right before the run-out grove in the last minute or 2 of music or in the run-out groove itself. It seems to happen when playing an LP from the start (most 7\" singles play all the way through - even the run-out groove). If it sticks and I replay just the last song, it seems to play through - it only seems to happen when the record is played all the way from the start. I am not using this to DJ - just playing records all the way through. I have read on your site that the tracking force should be set to 3 grams but that is twice the max in the specs - is that right? I have played with the arm height, anti-skate (from zero to 2 grams) - I have mounted the cartridge all the way back in the headshell and that seemed to help a bit. Any thoughts? I called Numark and they said increase the tracking force to 3 Grams and raise the arm height and set the anti-skate to zero - that did not solve it. I have mounted the cartridge 'by eye' do you guys make a tool to make sure it is mounted correctly?","completion":"It is likely that the tone arm is sticking. The stylus is a passive device; its movement is controlled completely by the record groove. But the tone arm must not bind at any point; if it does bind, it will tend to cause the stylus to skip back to a previous groove.We cannot think of a scenario where the stylus would cause a skip at just one part of a record. But your problem does fit the scenario of a tone arm bearing that binds when the arm is near the center of a record. We suggest you speak with a tone arm engineer at Numark to discuss possible binding of the tone arm bearings.For non-DJ work, the 3 grams of tracking force is too heavy. Set it to 1.5 grams and set the anti-skate to 1.5 grams. The M44G should work just fine IF the tone arm is not binding."}
{"prompt":"Just bought Shure SM58 mics over the internet. I've seen ads stating that mic came from \"non-smoking studio,\" but did not pay much attention. The mics I got came from a heavy smoking environment. What effect might smoke have on the elements and if something can be done, what?","completion":"Unlikely that the performance will be affected.Check out How should I clean my microphone?"}
{"prompt":"I own a wireless system with a SM58, and though I'm very happy with the system and its performance, I'm not happy about the boomy, bassy sound the SM58 gives me. If I buy a Beta 58A cartridge, will I get a less boomy sound from my mic? It's not that I don't like the SM58 sound, in fact I love it. I just don't like its sensitivity and the 'booms' it makes when I breath into it up close. I've seen performers use the Beta 58A, and I never once heard the problems I have with my SM58 (the breath booms), so I figured that mic wouldn't have that problem. So the Beta 58A has the same issues when it comes to sensitivity and 'booms'?","completion":"So the Beta 58A has the same issues when it comes to sensitivity and 'booms'? * Yes, it does.Experiment with new mic techniques. For example, try holding the mic different. Instead of having the mic directly under your nose (lots of breath noise from the nose), hold it off to the side of mouth like a jazz singer.Remember the mic is the singer's instrument and, as an instrument, there is technique that must be learned."}

He wishes to press any microphone to mute system, and then press any microphone to un-mute system, giving LED indication. I propose the microphone TTL o/p from each microphone is connected to a Crestron control system I/O port to sense contact closure, and a relay o/p closure to light the LED, assuming the microphone has onboard electronics to drive the LED, and only requires close contact. The Crestron will tell the conference system via ethernet to mute/un-mute the system. Will this work?","completion":"You are correct, except you require the MX392/C, NOT the MX393/C. The MX392 has three additional wires in the cable: 1) Logic Common/Ground; 2) LED control; 3) Switch status.The status of the LED on the MX392 can be controlled via an external closure. Connecting the LED Control wire to the Logic Common wire will illuminate the LED. (This assumes that the internal DIP switches of the MX392 have been properly configured.) The voltage used to illuminate the LED is a portion of the phantom power supplied to the mic.The Switch status is TTL. When the mic switch is depressed, the Switch Status wires changes from +5 volts to 0 volts (in relation to the Logic Common wire)."}

Can you advise me? Or maybe come up with other suggestions?","completion":"Which mic did you like? Both are excellent mics. Your choice must be based on what each mic does for your voice. That we cannot predict via email as we have never heard you sing through the SM58 or Beta 58.A singer choosing a mic for a singer is like a guitarist choosing an instrument. It makes no difference what other people think; it is what the musician hears.We do suggest you also try the Shure Beta 87. It will sound quite different than either 58 model."}
{"prompt":"I have a sound reinforcement problem. We have a Flamenco guitarist, singers, and dancers in a noisy restaurant. Reinforcing the guitar, cajones, and voices were easy to resolve. The problem is that the sounds from the dancers stomping can not be heard more than 15' from the wooden stage. We tried placing a Beta 58 at each side of the stage but the background sound was too high. Is there some way to pick-up the resonances directly from the wooden stage? The stage is about 20' wide and 15' deep. Placing a mic under the stage is not an acceptable solution. Any help would be appreciated.","completion":"The solution used on Broadway is to place a wireless transmitter on the dancer with a miniature lapel mic placed at the ankle of the dancer. This technique has been used for many of the successful dance shows on Broadway.You might also consider a vibrational pick-up on the stage like used on the top of a guitar or on the soundboard of a piano.

{"prompt":"I have a Shure BG 5.0 and when I move it, I can hear a movement. Do these mics have a battery inside it, and if so how do I remove and replace it?","completion":"The BG 5.0 or BG 5.1 can be powered by either an internal battery or by phantom power. The BG 5.0 does not come from the factory with a battery installed in it, but someone may have put one in yours after it was purchased or at the dealer. The handle unscrews right at where the label is so that you can access the battery compartment. Note this does not involve removing any screws on it. You should be able to do this by just twisting the handle in relationship to the part that has the switch."}
{"prompt":"I have an SM58 and the bottom 3-pronged part came out and broke away from the wires. Which wire (the blue or the red) goes to which prong?","completion":"The blue wire goes to pin 2. The red wire goes to pin 3.  "}

I currently use the Shure Beta 87A. Price is no object. I want the best sounding mic I can get my hands on...or head on, for that matter. Which headset is the \"best\"?","completion":"When compared to a Beta 87, we believe all headworn mics will disappoint.In the Shure line, try the Beta 54 wireless headworn mic. The Beta 54 is currently the best sounding headworn mic in the Shure line that can be used for live sound. But make certain you directly compare it to whatever wired mic you prefer, like the Beta 87.The technology does not yet exist that can make a tiny headworn mic sound as good as a handheld mic like the Beta 87. However, we are working hard at creating that technology."}
{"prompt":"Hi, I am looking for a the smallest and least visible headset made. We currently have a wireless system with lapel and our church pastor doesn't want to come off like a rock star.

{"prompt":"I need water and weather resistant mics to be used in a tropical forest. They will be left at the site for at least 3 months. Do you have any idea which one should I buy? ","completion":"We suggest the Shure SM63. It is often used for long periods under difficult environmental conditions. Shield it from direct rain. High humidity should present no problem, nor should the high heat.Avoid any type of condenser mic as they tend to fail in high heat and humidity. The SM63 is a dynamic mic."}
{"prompt":"I have a SHURE PE5EQ that I bought as a young adult 25 years ago and hardly ever used. I recently dug it out of storage and it does not work. I was told locally that it would have to be totally rebuilt inside and it is not worth it. Can you please advise?","completion":"Shure Service no longer repairs this mic.

{"prompt":"How can I identify a ULXD-GV wireless receiver that has always-on encryption?","completion":"Some ULXD4, ULXD4D, and ULXD4Q wireless receivers have always-on AES-256 wireless encryption that cannot be disabled.  These units are identified by the presence of the letters “GV” on the label on the bottom of the receiver and on the exterior of the product packaging. Note that “GV” receivers with always-on encryption utilize standard ULXD transmitters.  The encryption is operational as soon as a transmitter is paired with the receiver."}
{"prompt":"Can the 3-pin XLR output of the MV7 be fed with an analog mic level signal, that will then be converted by the internal MV7 DSP to provide a USB digital output signal?","completion":"Yes. An analog mic level signal fed into the MV7 XLR will show up on the MV7 USB audio output, combined with the MV7 on-board mic into one output channel. The converted signal will be down by 6 dB and will exhibit some loss in its low-end frequency response."}

{"prompt":"I've just bought a 520D, and have occasions where I cannot use my Fender amplifier for my harp. On these occasions, I use the High Impedance input on our sound mixer. But, when we recently played a large club, the mic input box, connected to the snake, connected to their mixer, didn't have Hi-Z inputs, all Low. Is there an in-line device that will attenuate my signal, while changing my connection from 1/4\" plug to standard low-Z 3 pin? I know I can wire my 520D either High or Low, but things are not consistent enough for hard-wiring in either configuration.","completion":"The A95U will work perfectly and convert the 520D into a low impedance, balanced output."}
{"prompt":"I bought a 550L mic. To wire it, it has balanced and unbalanced options. What does that mean?","completion":"An unbalanced mic connection has only two connection points: audio hot and ground/shield. A balanced mic connection has three connection points: audio hot, audio neutral, ground/shield.The mic will be connected to some type of electronic device. Look at the device's mic input and count the connection points. Two equals unbalanced; three equals balanced.Balanced is a better connection scheme."}
{"prompt":"Can you tell me what specific mic holder I can purchase to place my MX418 mics on a regular mic stand?Also would like to change one of the MX418 mics to a supercardioid... I know I can purchase the capsule but how difficult is it to change?","completion":"  The stand adapter for the MX418 or MX412 is model #A57F.The cartridges are very easy to change. You will notice that the very tip of the microphone unscrews."}
{"prompt":"Does dynamic range means the widest range that a mic can be able to cover (simplified meaning)?Does a maximum SPL means (in simplified meaning also) the loudest sound a microphone can handle?","completion":"Yes. It is the sound pressure level (SPL) range of a microphone. On the high SPL end, it assumes an undistorted output signal. On the low SPL end, it assumes an output signal that is greater than the self-noise (hiss) of the microphone's electronics.Yes, again assuming an undistorted output signal.A mic can \"handle\" SPL outside of its dynamic range, but the output signal will be useless - either distorted or lost in \"hiss\"."}
{"prompt":"I've heard the KSM32 and like it very much - and they've been VERY well received! How are the KSM44 and Beta 27 different in terms of sonic quality from the KSM32? For my home studio cost is a factor, but the \"right\" mic for vocals and instruments is most important.","completion":"The KSM44 and Beta 27 sound very similar to each other. The KSM32 has an extremely neutral, uncolored sound to it. The Beta 27 and KSM44 have a bit more warmth and body to them.We suggest that you visit your local Shure dealer to try them. Sound is very subjective. Only you can decide which mic you like best."}

{"prompt":"I just printed the manual for our SM91 microphone and find that it is indeed a cardioid pattern. But from where? Is it from the mounting plane perpendicularly out? From the edge opposite the cord fitting out? Perpendicular to the tilted plane rising from the edge that is opposite the cord fitting? ","completion":"If the SM91 is placed on table, the cardioid pattern would be in the horizontal plane. That is, the most sensitive point is at the table surface on the side were \"SM91\" is printed. The least sensitive point is exactly where the cable enters into the SM91. Think of the polar pattern as an SM58 laying flat on the table."}

{"prompt":"How do the theatre guys do it? I frequently have actors with lavs in their hair line or over their ears talk while hugging. I get a comb filter like sound when they do that. Often I do not have time to reduce the volume to one of the mics to reduce the comb filter distortion.I know some people route the lavs to different speakers, but when you have many scenes like that with many lavs, the routing can be quite a headache.","completion":"There are 3 methods:Reduce the volume of one of the microphones.Route the microphones to different loudspeakers.Use an automatic mixer inserted into your main console so that the automixer can turn the microphones on and off as they are being used. Essentially, this is the same as #1, but it is much easier."}

{"prompt":"I recently purchased a Shure SM10A-CN for my son to use on his Karaoke player. The karaoke player has the single female connection where the mic has the three prong. I purchased an adapter (HOSA GXP143 XLR - 1/2\" m - not a transformer) and when we plugged the mic in we picked up a radio station. Should I have used a different adaptor, or is there some way I can alleviate this problem?","completion":"The unscientific approach is to buy a Shure A85F transformer (or equivalent) and see if that solves the problem.The scientific approach is to get technical details about the karaoke player's mic input. Then send that information to Shure and receive our suggestions.The following lists the information we require:What specifications determine if a Shure microphone will properly operate with your camcorder or your tape recorder or your karaoke player or your computer sound card or your anything!Shure is often asked \"Will microphone model X work with my …….?\" While we would love to have the microphone input specifications of each and every device in the world that needs a microphone, it is an impossible task. So for us to help you select the proper microphone, we need you to provide the following three vital specifications for the microphone input of your device. Typically, these specifications will be provided in the Owner's Manual for your device or you may have to call the manufacturer of the device.VITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #1Typically called \"Input Sensitivity\" or \"Nominal Input Level\", this specification indicates how large of a signal the microphone must supply to satisfy the microphone input of your device. This specification might be given in millivolts (mV), or volts (V), or in a minus dB form (-dBV, -dBm, -dBu, -dBs).In the Shure product line, there is a wide variation of signal levels available depending on the microphone model. If you select a microphone whose signal level is too low for your device, the audio will be noisy and low in level. If you select a microphone whose signal level is too great for your device, the audio will be distorted and unintelligible. Proper matching of the microphone's signal level to your device's required input level is imperative.VITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #2Typically called \"Input Impedance\" or \"Actual Input Impedance\", this specification is important as it will determine the proper impedance range of the chosen microphone. This specification will be given in ohms. Contrary to popular audio mythology, the impedance of a microphone does not need to match the input impedance of your device.In the Shure product line, there are multiple impedances available depending on the microphone model. If you select a microphone whose impedance is lower than or equal to your device's input impedance, the microphone will work if it provides the proper signal level (see #1 above). If you select a microphone whose impedance is greater than your device's input impedance, the microphone will not deliver its full signal level to your device and the audio will be noisy and low in level.VITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #3This final specification is the type of microphone input connector on your device, how many connection points are in the connector, and what is the function of each connection point. This specification will be the name of the connector, such as: XLR female, 3.5mm mini-phone plug, TRS 1/4\" female phone jack, screw terminals, TINI QG connector. Each of these has at least two connection points and most have three (or more) connection points. It is imperative that the function of each connection point be known so that the proper microphone wiring can be determined.In the Shure product line, there are many wiring schemes available depending on the microphone model. If the microphone connections are not properly matched to your device's input connector, there may be no audio, or funny sounding audio, or the microphone might be damaged if there is an unknown voltage appearing on your device's connection points.CONCLUSIONAs you can see, there are many variables that affect whether a particular microphone will work with your device. Shure will be happy to assist in your microphone selection, but to do the job correctly, we need you to provide the pieces of this technical puzzle that Shure does not have: the audio input specifications of your device."}
{"prompt":"How do I make a wireless boundary microphone using the MX391?","completion":"Building a Wireless Desktop Microphone Using the MX391ProcedurePrepare the MX391 to connect to a Shure bodypack wireless transmitter.Unplug the microphone from its in-line preamplifier tube.  Set the tube aside, as it is not needed for the wireless application.  However, the preamplifier tube can be used later should the MX391 be needed in a wired configuration. Cut the factory installed TA4F connector from the cable.  If needed, trim the microphone cable to the desired length.Install a new TA4F connector.  The connector can be obtained from most electronics suppliers (Switchcraft TA4F) or from the Shure parts department (part number WA330).  The Shield (ground) must be connected to both Pin 1 and the metal body of the connector.  To connect to the body, solder a short jumper wire from pin 1 to the connector's internal metal cable grip.  The Red wire (bias voltage) connects to Pin 2, and the Black wire (audio) connects to both Pin 3 and Pin 4.Note: If the Shure transmitter body pack is metal (and not plastic), a new TA4F connector does NOT need to be installed.Parts Needed1 MX391 boundary microphone1 Shure wireless system with bodypack transmitter (almost all Shure bodypacks use the TA4F connector). 1 Switchcraft (or equivalent) TA4F Connector (available as Shure #WA330).

{"prompt":"I have an old Soundesign stereo system. I've been downloading my LP's into my computer. Some of the LP's seem to have a lot of static. Is there a needle or something that can reduce this static?","completion":"If the noise is indeed caused by static electricity, the Shure M97xE or Shure V15VxMR will help. Both have dynamic stabilizers that contain a carbon fiber brush the reduces static.If the noise is caused by dirt, use a LP disc washing system.If the noise is caused by vinyl damage, there are digital editing systems that reduce clicks and pops. An English company called CEDAR is a leader in this field."}

Either model is an entry level dynamic mic.Compared to the 565, the PE515 will:Have less low endHave less high endWill feedback easier "}
{"prompt":"I am looking for a lavalier microphone and think the MX184 would work but am not knowledgeable enough to know for sure if it is the best choice. We need a lavalier because our minister keeps hitting the boom mounted mic with his hands and I can not get him to keep it close enough to his mouth. He does not feel comfortable with it closer than two feet. I also am having a lot of trouble with picking up traffic noise as the building is close to a road. In addition, our minister sits in a chair and the mic is picking up the sound of his sleeve buttons and arms hitting the chair arms so I get a clicking noise along with thumps on the recordings. I use a Peavey 12 channel mixer and do have phantom power available. What mic would work best to reject all extraneous noise?","completion":"Of our lavalier microphones, the MX184 (supercardioid) has the most rejection of ambient noise. Whether it will reject everything you want it to, we don't know. Unfortunately, a microphone cannot tell the difference between your ministers voice, the traffic, or the click of buttons, so it will pick up anything it hears.We suggest you try the MX184 and also try the R185B (cardioid element) on the MX184 body. If neither of these work for you, the final solution would be a headworn microphone like the MX153. Putting the mic within one inch of the mouth will solve your problems, but we cannot predict if the minister will like the appearance of a headworn mic."}
{"prompt":"I have a four track Tascam recorder. I play acoustic music with my friends. I usally plug my Taylor guitar directly into the recorder and have a Shure SM58 for the voice recording. My question is, what would be a good mic to set up in the room to pick up the unplugged instruments such as a violin, or a resonator guitar?","completion":"If you want one mic to set in the center of the room, and pick up in all directions, you will require a mic with an omnidirectional pattern. The SM63 is an omnidirectional dynamic mic that will work well.Or you can use the KSM44 set to OMNI."}
{"prompt":"Recently, I acquired four of the renown Shure PE585 Unisphere A Dynamic microphones, for use on my newly acquired TEAC reel-to-reel 4-track tape recorder. All the mics need new wind/pop filters and one may need a new mic cartridge because it produces a noticeably weaker output signal than the others. How/where can I obtain these parts?","completion":"The PE585 was discontinued in 1981. Sorry, we no longer have parts for it. "}
{"prompt":"I need to mike a board meeting with 32 members sitting at 6 tables in the same room (for recording purposes only). I am guessing that one mike on each table would probably do it. What type of mike I need to use?","completion":"First, read the following:Audio Systems for Meeting FacilitiesThen, for microphones, we would recommend the MX393/O. For a cleaner sound, we recommend running the microphones into an automatic mixer such as the SCM810 (with the RKC800 XLR panel). One mic per table should be fine."}
{"prompt":"I am interested in upgrading my bands monitoring system. My band is currently a five piece, and I need a solution that will best serve my purpose. What I need to know is, how many systems will I have to buy to accomodate a five piece band all with PSM's? I have been told that I can run five sets with one transmitter. I hope this is correct. Also, what advantages will I have by using a limiter to control sound peaks to conserve hearing loss?","completion":"What I need to know is, how many systems will I have to buy to accommodate a five piece band all with PSM's?* If everyone will be satisfied listening to the same stereo mix, you require one transmitter and five receivers. Or you can have two independent mono mixes using the same set up.What advantages will I have by using a limiter to control sound peaks to conserve hearing loss?* There are limiters in each PSM receiver to control sound peaks. We suggest these limiters always be used. Putting a high quality limiter just before the PSM transmitter input is often done by professional bands, just to have yet another level of hearing protection."}
{"prompt":"I recently bought a Shure 556S, and was trying to figure out when the microphone was made. The serial number is 9041V. Is there any way to get a ballpark birth-year??","completion":"The mic was made from 1951 until 1981. The serial number does not help. It is simply a manufacturing lot number; it does not designate the year of manufacture."}
{"prompt":"I just acquired a 50's 55S and a 556 which have 1/4\" plugs for connecting. How do I rewire it for XLR connections?","completion":"Depending on the year of 55S that you have, it will have either a 3 pin XLR connector or a 3 pin screw-on Amphenol connector. These are both wired the same way.Pin 1 - GroundPin 2 - Audio +Pin 3 - Audio -More information:Mic cable for Shure 55SThe 556 came with a permanently attached cable.

{"prompt":"We have an FP24 for use in our department. It seems that the battery life in the device awfully short.On one recent event, we found ourselves having to swap batteries every 20 minutes! Not the best situation for a live recording. We're using Duracell Procell batteries. Are we experiencing normal battery wear here, or might there be something wrong with our FP24?","completion":"Two AA alkaline batteries should last at least 2 hours. This means the FP24 can draw up to as much as 600 milliamps. If you have a means of testing the current draw of the FP24, do so.Batteries that die every 20 minutes means your FP24 is pulling nearly 1,200 milliamps -way too much! A milliamp current measurement will confirm or deny this theory.You might also want to go buy some new, fresh batteries from a store to verify that your problem is not weak batteries. It is possible that the lot of Procells that you have were sitting on a shelf for a few years and have lost their charge."}

Any suggestions?","completion":"Yes, you likely require a microphone preamp. There are many available from dealers."}
{"prompt":"I have bought an SM2 microphone. The end of the cable has five conductors. I have a 3-pin male XLR connector. I guess I can not use this connector. What connector do I need to connect with the SM2's cable?","completion":"Typically, a 3 pin male XLR connector is used for the mic output of the SM2. A stereo male 1/4\" phone plug is typically used for the headphone input to the SM2 ear pieces.Another option is a six pin XLR connector. Pins 1, 2, 3 carry the mic signal; pins 4, 5, 6 carry the headphone signal.The SM2 is supplied with a bare-ended cable because it is used with a variety of devices. The user adds the appropriated connectors to the SM2. "}

{"prompt":"I need a drum mic that I can connect to a wireless system. The Beta 98 is the perfect mic, but I'm not sure to which wireless system it can be connected. What kind of connector does it have? Could a wireless system replace the pre-amp?","completion":"Yes, the Beta 98 can be connected to a Shure wireless transmitter. Any Shure transmitter with a 4 pin Tini QG connector can be used with the Beta 98. The preamp that comes with the Beta 98 is not used when connecting the mic to a transmitter; only use the preamp when the Beta 98 is used in a wired configuration."}
{"prompt":"Why does the SM57 sound so much different than the SM58? I know the grill affects the sound and so does porting and microphone body shape and size. The specs say the SM57 goes a bit lower yet many people feel the SM58 is bassier sounding. I'm guessing their perception of bass is actually lower mids but I can't find any frequency graphs on your site to confirm this. I would have expected the SM57 to sound bassier because a greater proximity effect is possible since you can get closer to the cartridge but I guess many people's sense of bass is not really low frequency extension.","completion":"The SM58 and the SM57 share the same mic element, the Unidyne III. The only difference between the these two models is the grill design.The grill design does affect the high frequency response, particularly above 8,000 Hz.The SM57 grill design allows more proximity effect because the mic diaphragm can be placed closer to the sound source. Proximity effect increases each time the distance from the mic to the source is halved. When a mic is placed very close, it is quite easy to halve the distance: 1 inch to 1/2 inch; 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch; etc. Remove the ball grill from the SM58 and it will be more similar to the SM57 in its low frequency response.Any other differences you hear between the SM57 and SM58 are likely to be subjective (psycho-acoustic) or due to slight manufacturing differences due to part tolerance.Why does Proximity Effect Occur?"}
{"prompt":"I am installing a focus group room, i.e. a place where several people meet around a table and talk about a particular topic leaded by a trained specialist.

{"prompt":"When using the VP88 on special occasions, and it's becoming more often, (love the mike), I am getting some radio station interference on 1290kc. All inputs are balanced. No other mike does this and there are many types and brands. Only does it when the mike is processing the signal, such as, when using the MS position on the output selection switch. The mike operates without any interference. \"H\" \"M\" \"L\" positions have interference. Used for Sound Reinforcement/Recording. Cathedral is about 1.5 miles from the offending station tower. Power is 5000 watts. Would an isolation transformer 1:1 on each output help? If that is the answer can you recommend one?","completion":"The AM RF signal is probably being picked up by the mic cable, carried into the mic on the cable shield, demodulated inside of the mic to audio, and sent back out on the mic cable inner conductors as audio.Instead of isolation transformers, we suggest the use of two in-line RF filters - one for each output channel of the mic. Look at the Shure A15RFWe cannot guarantee success, but these RF filters have proven very effective in the past with other RFI problems.Also see: Best mic cable to reduce interference from AM radio station"}

Here are two companies:ACO Pacific at https://www.acopacific.comLawson Inc at https://www.lawsonmicrophones.com"}
{"prompt":"Why is a mic with a magnet called “dynamic?”","completion":"The adjective “dynamic” is related to the noun “dynamo.”  A dynamo is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy using magnetic means.  Thus, dynamic may be used for a moving coil mic, like the SM58, or a ribbon mic, like the KSM 313. "}
{"prompt":"At Fuji news in London UK we use a 50AC acoustic coupler which has proved useful for reporters in the field. I would like to get hold of another or similar device, any sources?","completion":"We wish we could help. The 50AC was discontinued in the early 1990's due to very poor sales. We have been unable to locate any other manufacturer of such a device, probably because of the extremely small potential market.You might try companies that make acoustic modems as the operational concept is similar.

Can you tell me anything about it...age, specs, tracking force, etc? I'm tracking it at 2 grams and it works perfectly...great bass. I understand it was one of you first magnetics from the late 50's.","completion":"The M3D moving magnet cartridge was first sold in the late 1950's and was last sold in the 1970's. There were no date codes used so it is impossible to know the age of your unit. It was designed to track at 3 to 5 grams, but that was because of the tone arm designs of the 1950's.If you find that it works well at 2 grams, keep that setting.

{"prompt":"What is the difference between the SM87A and Beta 87A?","completion":"The SM87A and Beta87A are both supercardioid, condenser microphones designed for handheld vocal applications. The differences between the two are subtle, and best determined by auditioning both microphones at a local Shure dealer, to determine which one sounds better for your specific application. The Beta87A, however, does feature a more consistent supercardioid polar pattern, giving it a slight edge in gain-before-feedback."}
{"prompt":"Currently I have 4 mics into a 4 channel mixer and need to add 4 more mics on the same mixer. I would probably use XLR 'Y' connectors to insert 2 mic cables into each input.

We do all our worldwide conference and videoconferencing meetings in this room. Do you have any product that we could use? I am not an expert in this, but I was told that we can't use a wireless microphone because they use batteries and the batteries do not last more than four hours. Is this true with your system.","completion":"Our QLXD, ULXD or MXW series would be appropriate for your application. Next, you need to determine which type of microphone you want. If you want a boundary microphone, look at the MXW6 with the MXW wireless system, or the ULXD6 with a ULXD receiver. If you want a thin gooseneck microphone, look at the MXW8 or ULXD8 and the MX405/MX410/MX415.The other possibility is to place a mixer underneath the table. You can use any wired microphone plugged into the mixer and run the output of the mixer into a single wireless bodypack. The battery life of a wireless microphone transmitter is 6 to 8 hours when using alkaline batteries."}
{"prompt":"When a unit is activated, does a particular LED light up? When a low speaker starts speaking, which LED's light up and what happens as the unit reponds? What happens a loud speaker starts speaking, which LED lights up and then what happens as the unit reponds. I understand the process that the unit completes but I'm trying to determine if the LED tells me what is happening.","completion":"The LED action all depends on what features of the DP11EQ you are using.The BYPASS LED lights only when the DP11EQ is in bypass mode.The SIGNAL LED lights (and varies in intensity) when an input signal is present.The CLIP LED lights only when the input signal nears the distortion point.The DYNAMIC GAIN LEDs light only when the signal level is being reduced or boosted. This means at least one of the DP11EQ dynamics processors is being used (limiter, compressor, AGC). If none of the dynamics processors are selected, this string of LEDs will not light up.The DATA LED lights only when the DP11EQ receives data from a computer.The POWER LED lights when the DP11EQ receives AC power.These functions are described in page 3 of the DP11EQ manual: \"Overview - Front Panel\"."}
{"prompt":"I have one of your Model 592T microphones, and I need to replace the RJ-45 connector at the radio end that was damaged. What is the wiring diagram for your type ALM25 cord, for a Motorola MCX-1000 model radio?","completion":"The pinout for the ALM-25 cord is as follows:Pin 1- No ConnectionPin 2- No Connection (Black Lead Occupying Slot, No Contact Used)Pin 3- DrainPin 4- YellowPin 5- BluePin 6- RedPin 7- No Connection (White Lead Occupying Slot, No Contact Used)Pin 8- No Connection"}
{"prompt":"My wife and I tried to boost the gain on the KSM32 so that the mike would pick up my voice, my guitar and her mandolin \"live\" from a few feet away. The result was thin and \"tinny.\" Is this mike designed only for close-proximity or can it be used effectively at a distance?","completion":"The \"warmth\" you hear when using the KSM32 up close is called proximity effect. It is a natural characteristic of directional microphones. Most people like this warmth, but it means the mic must be used quite close to the performer.Omnidirectional mics do not have proximity effect and sound the same when used up close or at a distance. The KSM44 mic has selectable patterns so you can have proximity effect or not.See the following link for more details:Microphone Techniques for Music - Studio Recording"}
{"prompt":"Today I purchased a Shure wireless system for my bass guitar. I hooked everything up to my bass (Ibanez 800 w/ active pickups) and amplifier and into my rack case. However, when I turned it all on, the sound that came out was very muddy and distorted. also the audio peak indicators were red almost the whole time. I then took it out of the rack and tried it only to get the same results. What can be causing this?","completion":"Most instruments with active pickups have much hotter output than instruments with passive pickups. This usually requires a gain adjustment on the transmitter. Find the gain adjustment on the transmitter, and adjust it until the Audio Peak indicator on the receiver only flashes on the loudest notes. Also, only turn up the output level control on the receiver until the volume level is equivalent to that of using a cable. This setup will prevent overdriving any portion of the signal chain."}
{"prompt":"I own a V-15 III L-M for about 25 years (yes a long time). What the maximum life time is of the cartridge and the stylus assembly? Is it still useable or should I buy a new stylus? I did not use it from 1983 until now, it still works, but I can imagine that it is not in a top condition. I found out from the other questions that the replacement stylus is VN35MR.","completion":"The diamond tip on a stylus wears out after 500 to 1,000 hours of playing time. The amount of wear can only be determined by using a microscope designed to examine styli.There is a rubber bushing in the stylus assembly that ages and becomes brittle with time. After 25 years, this bushing is likely not as pliable as it should be.The cartridge body does not contain any parts that age. Only the stylus assembly contains parts that wear and age."}
{"prompt":"My supplier advised that above choir mic has been discontinued. Reference to your web site confirms in that it is not listed along with the cardioids. This shatters my plans for ambience recording of our two organs. Can you provide two omnis on special order?

{"prompt":"I am in need of an acceptable replacement for a Shure M75CS Cartridge as it appears to no longer be available. My grandson broke off the stylus. This cartridge is used in a BSR McDonald 510 automatic turntable which is a component of a Heathkit Compact Stereo Center Model AD-27A that I assembled around 1968 -1970. Needless to say there is sentimental value involved here. I really only need the stylus (.0006\" spherical diamond, Shure N75C) but I am not sure I can get that without buying the whole cartridge. The phono cartridge has a tracking pressure of 3 to 5 grams. Where can I get a replacement?","completion":"The N75-6 stylus is no longer available from Shure.The N75-6 tracking range is 1.5 to 3 grams. Use the 3 gram setting on your tonearm.The N75C stylus is no longer available from Shure."}
{"prompt":"We have a SM94 mic at our church and it has no on/off switch. This causes us many problems, and is there any in-line switch you sell? Do you have any suggestions how we can solve this problem?","completion":"Professional microphones rarely have on/off switches as the microphones are controlled by the sound engineer at the mixing console. The engineer does not want a performer accidentally switching off a mic during a performance. Therefore, no on/off switches on professional mics.If you intend to keep the SM94 and it is powered by an internal battery, Switchcraft offers a female XLR connector with an on/off switch.If the SM94 is powered via phantom power, installing an on/off switch in the cable run is not recommended as there will be a loud \"pop\" each time the mic is turned on or off."}
{"prompt":"Are there any manuals available for the Shure C/PEK-3 stereo cartridge analyzer? I have found a used one, and would be interested in purchasing manuals or test LP's for it. Do the original Shure TTR-117 test records work with the C/PEK-3 analyzer?","completion":"Download CPEK/3 InstructionThe test records supplied with the C/PEK-3 were: TTR 103 and TTR 107. The 107 specifically tested for output level and channel crosstalk. We have never tried the TTR 117 with the C/PEK-3."}
{"prompt":"When do you use a low impedance mic vs a high impedance mic?Is Prologue 14H suitable for vocal performance?","completion":"The choice of impedance is determined by the input specifications of the device into which you connect the microphone. The device might be: a mic mixer, a tape recorder, a guitar amplifier, a computer sound card, etc.Yes. It is an entry level product. It is perfectly adequate for a beginner or for use in the home."}

{"prompt":"I need to buy a piano mic for sound re-enforcement purposes and it has to be mounted inside the piano. Can you please suggest one for a Grand Piano and one for an Up-right Piano?","completion":"For mounting inside a piano, the best choice is a boundary microphone attached to the underside of the piano lid. The Shure microphone designed for this application is the Beta 91A, a cardioid pattern, condenser, boundary microphone. This microphone will work for both a grand and upright piano.To see which microphones we recommend for piano, see our Application Guides.For help in placing microphones for a piano, see our online booklet \"Microphone Techniques for Music - Sound Reinforcement\"."}
{"prompt":"What are the specs on the Lemo connector for the UC1 and the U1L?","completion":"The Lemo connector that mates with a 4 pin Lemo-equipped Shure UHF transmitter is Lemo part:  FFA.OS.304.CLAC42.The Lemo is offered because it is popular in theater applications.  Though the Lemo is a superb connector, we favor the Tini QG connector as it is less expensive, widely available, and easier to wire than the Lemo.Here is a technical description of Lemo FFA.OS.304.CLAC42:Shell Style/Model: FFA - straight plug with a collet for the mic cableSize/Series: 0S - metal with a half-moon insert to assist proper alignment between the mating connectors; this plug has two male pins (numbered 1 and 2) and two female sockets (numbered 3 and 4)Number of Contacts: Four (the \"4\" in 304); wires are to be soldered to the contacts; recommended wire size is AWG 24 or smallerHousing Material: C - brass shell and collet nut, both chrome plated; nickel plated brass latch sleeve and mid-piecesInsulation Material: PEEK ( a semicrystalline polymer thermoplastic)Cable Strain Relief: C42 - will take cables with a diameter of 3.3 to 4.1 mmDimensions: length - 34.5 mm; diameter - 9.0 mmFor additional technical details, go to: www.lemo.com"}
{"prompt":"I have an N78 stylus that I would like to use to record some old 78-rpm discs. The data sheet included with the stylus says that it fits the M33 and M77 cartridges. The cartridge that I bought the stylus for was stolen years ago, but it must have been an M33. I find nothing on your web site to indicate that such a cartridge ever existed; however, the M3D is listed there as a vintage cartridge no longer in production. Can you confirm that the M33 and M3 are indeed different beasts? In particular, can you confirm that the N78 will not fit the M3?","completion":"There was a M33-5 and a M33-7. Probably from the early 70's. The M3D existed up until the mid-1980's. They were not the same cartridge. The M3D was an entry level cartridge. The N78 will not fit in the M3D."}
{"prompt":"What is a good shock absorbing desk mic stand for use with the Shure SM58 mic? ","completion":"Shock mounting an SM58 on a desk stand can be done a couple different ways.The discontinued S39A desk stand provided shock isolation between the table surface and the microphone stand adapter.The A55HM isolation mount fastens to any desk stand."}
{"prompt":"Consumer Reports, who always top-ranked your fine cartridges, said in their 1986 buying guide review of my receiver: \"low phono input capacitance may slightly degrade the performance of some cartridges.\" Could you please tell me what this means in regard to cartridge selection, viz, am I looking for a certain output voltage? The instruction manual for the Onkyo TX-930 states sensitivity and impedence : 2.5mV/50 kohms; phono overload: 120mV RMS at 1 kHz, 0.2% THD; Signal-to-noise ratio 80dB (at 5mV input, IHF-A). This is the only info I have.","completion":"The V15VxMR prefers an input with a capacitance of 250 pF.(The output voltage is of no concern in this case.) Contact Onkyo. They should know the input capacitance. If the capacitance is lower than 200 pF, the high frequency response of the V15V will be boosted slightly. If it sounds too bright, you can add capacitance to the Onkyo input by soldering capacitors to the input jacks.If the capacitance is higher than 300 pF, the high frequency response of the V15V will be reduced slightly.Our advice: don't worry about it. These frequency response changes are quite small."}
{"prompt":"We want to use an SCM810 mixer as an eight channel equalized, gated group of preamps. Our studio mics would be fed through each channel to the direct outputs and then to eight line inputs of an audio/video master control switcher. I understand that the 810 can be modified in the field so that the direct outputs are post eq., post level control, and gated. Is this correct? Also the site manual states that the direct output when modified to gated out is without \"NOMA\". What does this mean?","completion":"What you are suggesting is possible. The modification instructions are described in the User Guide of the SCM810. This would change the direct outs to be post eq, post level control, and gated.NOMA stands for Number of Open Microphone Attenuation. Every time the number of open microphones doubles, the mixer will decrease the master output by 3 dB. This keeps a consistent output level, regardless of how many people are talking. This attenuation is on the master output, thus does not affect the direct outputs."}
{"prompt":"I am looking to set up permanent recording facilities in my bandroom, a British style brass band (upward and forward facing instuments with percussion). I would be able to hang mics from the ceiling if necessary. The facilities need not be to studio and professional standard, but good enough for an output for recording and playback for the band to listen to. The room is very dead and around 15 feet by 35 feet. What sort of mics should I use?, and how many of them?","completion":"We suggest a two microphone stereo recording. Consider using two SM81 microphones, mounted with two A53M shock mounts, connected to one A27M stereo mic adapter, held in the air by one S15A five-meter high stand.To view all the microphones that we recommend for stereo recording, see our online Selection Guides.To read more about two mic stereo techniques, please see \"Microphones Techniques for Music - Studio Recording\" at: Educational Booklets"}

{"prompt":"I am trying to use a laptop computer, microphone and probably a preamp to record all sounds present in a police cruiser. I am going to use these recording to supply background noise while testing a speech recognition system for the police. I need to be able to pickup everything (i.e. engine noise, sirens, voice, wind...). I have read several of you technical support documents on connecting professional microphones to a soundcard, so I have fairly good understanding about impedance and signal strength. Could you please recommend an appropriate omni-directional microphone and preamplifier for this situation?","completion":"Consider the Shure SM63 microphone, used in conjunction with a battery powered mic preamp such as manufactured by Sound Devices."}
{"prompt":"I am trying to find a replacement mixer for Church. The old one was a Shure model M68, four mic inputs, one aux input - each with adjustable level and a master output control. It was being used for the area of the music group to add more mics as necessary and control them in common. I recently attended a seminar at a motel complex where I saw a unit looking suspiciously like it with a slightly newer look. I believe it was a model M68FCA. I need to find a replacement. Do you have a recommendation?","completion":"The SCM268 is a direct replacement."}
{"prompt":"I'm a long-time user of your UHF U4D system. I'm using the Beta 87 handheld mic and am wondering whether or not I can use it w/any other Shure UHF receiver. i.e. Can I program the mic to the UHF channel of, say your UC receiver or even one of your UT receivers?","completion":"The U2/Beta 87 microphone could be used with a UC receiver as long as the receiver was in the same frequency band as the transmitter. The frequency bands are UA or UB.The UC receiver does not have as many available frequencies as the U4 receivers do. Also the battery indicator on the receiver is not valid either.The U2/Beta 87 microphone cannot be used with the UT receiver."}
{"prompt":"When was the HST 50's manufactured?What were their specifications?What was the suggested retail in US dollars per set (2 speakers) in the year manufactured?","completion":"The historical records on the Shure HTS line are not complete as the entire business was sold off during the early 1990's. But we will attempt to answer your questions based on the remaining records.The HTS 50 line was available in 1988 to 1990. The line consisted of the: HTS50LRS (left, right, surround); HTS50CF (center front); HTS50SW (sub-woofer).HTS (Home Theater System) ManualsPrice lists cannot be found."}

{"prompt":"I am looking to get my church grand piano mic'ed up. I am interested at getting a boundary mic because I heard they were good and I would be able to use them with the piano lid closed- (that is why I like them better than the condenser mics). Which mic do you recommend and how do I mount it?","completion":"For piano miking ideas, see page 24 of this link: Microphone Techniques for Music - Sound ReinforcementYou can use self-adhering Velcro to attach a boundary mic to a piano lid. Typically the Velcro attached to the lid can be carefully removed later without damaging the finish.Some sound engineers place a boundary mic directly on the piano soundboard, with the mic sitting on a computer mouse pad for isolation.In the Shure line, the Beta 91A is used for this type of close piano miking. However, we do not guarantee you will like the sound. Only you can make that decision after you hear the mics in your piano. Not everyone likes a piano that is miked so closely. It is a \"rock and roll\" sound, not a \"classical music\" sound.Another common piano mic is the Shure SM81, mounted on a boom arm, and positioned over the strings. Again, please read the miking idea booklet (linked above) carefully before you make any buying decision."}
{"prompt":"I have a \"SHURE LX4 WIRELESS SYSTEM.\" My power adapter has a bad connection on it. I need to get a new one and would like to have an extra for a backup. What power supply do I need?","completion":"The LX4 uses the PS43 power adapter. "}
{"prompt":"I am interested in using a wireless with an accordion equipped with condenser mics. Output jack of accordion is standard 1/4 inch. Which wireless should I pic?","completion":"Any of our systems are available as guitar systems that would have a 1/4\" cable to go into the transmitter. These should work for you."}
{"prompt":"I just had a quick question. I currently own a Beta 58 wireless. I do love this mic. Aside from singing with the band I also DJ quite a bit. Is there a compatible bodypak that I can buy to be able to use a head set with the receiver that I already have, or do I have to buy a new headset altogether.","completion":"You can purchase a body pack and headset separately for any of our wireless systems. The Beta 58 microphone cartridge is offered on several of our wireless systems, so you will need to determine which wireless system you have. You can then purchase the bodypack and headset from your local Shure dealer.You will not be able to use the headset and the handheld at the same time. Only one transmitter can be on at any given moment."}
{"prompt":"Where can I find info on the SM61?","completion":"Here's a link to the user guide.https://pubs.shure.com/guide/SM61/en-US.pdf"}

{"prompt":"I am about to buy a new digital recorder (Akai DPS16i) that has 2 XLR inputs and 6 1/4 jacks. In order to plug more than two mics into it I would use an impedance transformer to plug the extra mics into the 1/4 inch jacks. But before I purchase the new machine, Is there any sort of sound degradation when converting the plug type, enough that I should look into a machine with more XLR inputs?","completion":"It all depends upon the quality of the transformer used in the impedance adapter. The majority of these adapters are not used in high performance systems, and therefore are not the highest quality.Our advice: look for a device with more XLR inputs."}
{"prompt":"I regularly need to mic acoustic pianos - both upright and grand - for performance. I also want to record some on my grand at home, but the emphasis is on performance. This needed for classical/show-tune solos as well as accompaniment.From descriptions, I'm leaning toward the SM81, but it also appears to be extremely directional. I can afford more say for a KSM32 if that makes more sense, but I don't want to overpay for unnecessary recording fidelity. I want to make clean, good-sounding recordings to send friends but I'm not trying to set up a professional sound studio! What's your recommendation?","completion":"If you want to make stereo recordings, try two unidirectional mics on a Shure A27M stereo mic adapter. The models to consider are: 1) SM81; 2) SM94; 3) KSM141 / KSM137.KSM32 would be great but is overkill for your needs. All these mics can also be used for live sound."}

{"prompt":"I just bought the SCM262, and won't be able to test it for a while (waiting for microphones) but I had a question about the inputs \"MIC 1\" and \"MIC 2\": Does input \"MIC 1\" output on the Left or Right channel? I need the mixer to interface two mics to a \"consumer\" tape deck's left and right inputs separately.","completion":"The mic 1 input goes to both the left and right outputs. The mic 2 input also goes to both the left and right outputs. If you want mic 1 to just go to the left output and mic 2 to just go to the right output, you will have to modify the mixer internally. This modification is described in the User Guide supplied with the mixer."}
{"prompt":"I play a Parker Classic and use a MESA Heartbreaker Amp. What is the best wireless system?","completion":"Shure offers several wireless systems.Before you make any buying decision, we suggest you read the following educational pieces:Introduction to Wireless Microphone Systemshttps://www.shure.com/publications/us_pro_intro_to_wireless_ea.pdfSelection and Operation of Wireless Microphone Systemshttps://www.shure.com/publications/selection_and_operation_of_wireless_microphone_systems_english.pdfFinally, do not buy any wireless system until you have tried it with your guitar and your amplifier.

{"prompt":"I have a 444D microphone with a standard 4 pin connector on the end for amateur radio use. I don't want to take apart the original plug if I don't have to and would like to make a jumper to my present radio, a TenTec Triton 2 which requires a 1/4\" plug. What color wire corresponds to which connector on the original plug?","completion":"The 444D's, like many of our communications microphones, was manufactured without a connector. Connectors were added by dealers or by radio manufacturers who bought the microphones for their radios.So, there was no \"standard\" connector for this microphone."}
{"prompt":"I'm a voice talent looking to install a home studio using my computer. I've had several offers for long distance work if I can record my voice and email a finished MP3 file.

{"prompt":"I connected my SM58 to my computer sound card microphone input for recording. The problem is that the sound is very quiet even with the computer volume control turned all the way up. How do I connect the mic to a computer?","completion":"What you are experiencing is the difference in level between different devices. Low impedance microphones, like the SM58 have a very low output level. A guitar, on the other hand, has a much hotter output. The sound card on your computer requires a hotter level.Computer has a USB port.To connect a professional microphone to a computer, you will need to bypass the computer sound card and use a USB interface, such as the Shure MVi or X2u USB Adapter. These are high quality microphone preamps with a USB computer interface. They are an outboard audio interface. That is, you would no longer use the sound card that came in your computer. They do supply phantom power for condenser microphones. You can also purchase a microphone, such as the Shure MV5 or MV51, that have built-in USB ports.Computer does not have a USB port.If you do not have a USB port on your computer, you can try one of the following solutions. The MVi and X2u USB adapters will work better than the following solutions.The first non-USB possibility is to interface a professional microphone with a computer soundcard through the use of a microphone preamp.The second non-USB possibility is to use a transformer, such as the Shure A96F, to help boost the level of your SM58 to something that would likely be appropriate for the sound card. The A96F has a female XLR on one end and an 1/8\" connector on the other end. Place the transformer at the computer and use a standard XLR cable between it and your SM58. The transformer will be less expensive than the microphone preamp, but it may not provide enough gain for your particular sound card. The A96F will not work with a phantom powered condenser microphone."}
{"prompt":"I am using a ULX-D in the X52 band (900 MHz band). Occasionally, I encounter interference but it does not happen all the time. How can I avoid this interference?","completion":"In the United States, the ULXD-X52 operates in the 902 to 928 MHz band.  Though this band is not used for broadcast TV, the 902 to 928 MHz band is used for other non-licensed wireless devices; the band is not reserved only for wireless microphones.  These other devices can be industrial, scientific, security, educational, or medical, and they have the same rights to operate in this frequency band as the wireless microphones. No device has priority over another device.Here are examples of identified devices known to operate in this band:Wireless network that reports a power outage to the local electric company.  This device was located on a utility pole outside of a church.  The device used \"frequency-hopping\" and can occasionally \"hop\" directly onto a ULXD operating frequency.A security system in a television studio.  This device emitted bursts of RF energy in the 900 MHz band.A commercial phone system, made in the early 1990s, in a church. Every 15 minutes, this phone control center would emit a very strong (almost one watt!), 900 MHz band signal that queried the wireless phones: \"Are you on?\"  \"What frequency are you using?\" This RF burst from the phone system produced one second of audible interference in a 900 MHz wireless mic system.A \"timing mat\" used at high school and college wrestling matches.A Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) system used for running races.  Each runner has a unique RFID tag.  As the runner crosses over an antenna placed on the ground, the exact time of the crossing is logged.Sources of ULXD-X52 interference would typically be nearby.  When seeking the source of interference, look for devices with antennas which are within 200 feet of the ULXD receiver.With the examples given above, there are two possible solutions:Replace the ULXD-X52 system with a system that operates in the UHF TV band, orPower off (or replace) the device causing the interferenceA simple test to determine if the problem is local interference is to operate the ULXD in a different environment, at least one mile away from the venue.  If the root cause is local interference, the ULXD will work fine in a different environment. If the ULXD needs repair, it will work poorly no matter where it is used.  A more accurate test is for a local wireless microphone expert to employ an RF spectrum analyzer.  The analyzer can display the frequency and strength of the signal causing the interference.Here is the original announcement from Shure about the ULX-D X52 band - dated August 2015:Shure announced that its renowned ULX-D® Digital Wireless Systems are now available in the 900 MHz ISM frequency band. Targeted for use where UHF \"TV band\" spectrum is limited or congested, ULX-D 900 MHz features components and accessories optimized for use within regional variations of the 902-928 MHz spectrum, generally known as the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band.With the introduction of industry-leading ULX-D Digital Wireless Systems capable of operating in the unlicensed 900 MHz band, customers can experience high-quality digital wireless audio in an alternative band, free of the regulatory issues wireless microphone users currently face, or may eventually face, in the heavily-saturated UHF TV band.\"Shure has been at the forefront of spectrum topics, serving as a source for the latest information about the UHF TV Band Incentive Auction, explaining the impact for wireless microphone users, and advocating on behalf of the industry,\" said Nick Wood, Category Director for Wireless Products at Shure. \"As awareness of the upcoming spectrum change increases, we continue to research and develop solutions for wireless microphone users.  We saw the opportunity to adapt the digital technology of our ULX-D systems to the specific requirements of the 900 MHz ISM band while keeping the same great performance and feature sets that have made these systems successful.\"As part of its ongoing commitment to support wireless microphone users with superior wireless solutions for an ever-evolving spectrum landscape, Shure has conducted extensive scanning, site surveys, and product testing in the 900MHz ISM spectrum.  The new ULX-D option performs to the same high standards of that system when the application and the RF environment are a good fit. The 900 MHz ISM band may also be used by devices such as wireless internet access points, security systems, smart meters, Bluetooth devices, two-way radios, and intercoms. Because many of these services transmit in short bursts across multiple frequencies, this RF environment can be less predictable than the TV band has typically been. For this reason, Shure has announced that the latest version of its Wireless Workbench® 6 software (version WWB 6.11.2) will feature a new Site Survey tool that enables customers to assess the availability of 900MHz ISM spectrum in a particular venue. The Site Survey Tool uses the receiver to capture a long-term scan and processes the data to provide a Usability Report, indicating an approximate number of usable channels in the ISM band.In general, ULX-D 900 MHz systems are best suited for indoor use, where the environment can be assessed before the systems are installed. Usage outside of these applications is certainly an option, but Shure recommends consulting with an authorized retailer if there is any question about which band is the best fit when purchasing ULX-D Digital Wireless Systems.In the U.S., the ULX-D 900 MHz system can support up to 12 compatible channels per frequency band, or up to 73 channels in high density mode."}
{"prompt":"What are the various earphone and headphone specifications?","completion":"Understanding Earphone/Headphone SpecificationsThough one of the most common items in the audio chain, earphones or headphones may not always work properly. Common problems are distorted audio, low level with the volume at maximum, or high level with the volume at minimum. This bulletin will explain earphone/headphone specifications, which ones are important, and how to choose earphones for an audio system.Let's differentiate between headphones and earphones. A headphone consists of one or two transducers (usually miniature speakers) that are attached to a metal or plastic headband. This headband provides proper placement of the transducers over the ear; the headband rests on top or behind the head. There are two common types: open-back and closed-back. The open-back type has acoustic ports on the outside that increase bass response, but has the downside of allowing background noise to bleed through into the ear. The closed type completely covers the ear, thus reducing background noise. A secondary advantage is that sound originating from the headphones will not radiate outward. Closed-back are preferred for applications such as studio recording where noise must be minimized.Earphones are also transducers but with no headband. They can be placed on the pinna (earflap) or inside the ear canal. The former, known as \"earbuds\", are usually the open-air type, since small transducers can not generate low frequencies without acoustic ports. The latter, known as \"in ear\" earphones, use a foam or other soft material to hold the earphone in the ear canal, thus isolating it from ambient noise. Forming an acoustic seal makes the ear canal part of the earphone \"system\" and modifies its frequency response. The advantages are that less volume is required, and audio quality is typically better.Most headphone and earphone specifications show actual impedance and sensitivity. Some others go a step further and show maximum/clipping level and frequency response. These specifications define how each unit will work with an audio system. On the audio system side, pertinent specifications are output impedance, power output, and/or clipping level.ImpedanceImpedance is opposition to the flow of current. The higher impedance, the less current will flow. Impedance is measured in Ohms, indicated by the Greek sign Omega (Ω). Earphones and headphones range from 8 Ohms to 600 Ohms or higher. The audio source (the headphone output) also has an impedance rating. To obtain maximum power transfer (all usable power from the source reaches the earphones) impedances should match. However, that's rarely the case. When impedances don't match, there is either a loss of voltage or of current, in other words, a loss of power. This power loss can be calculated with the following formula:Where- RS: Source impedance (the impedance of the audio system's headphone output)- RL: Load impedance (the impedance of the earphones or headphones)Let's assume we want to use earphones with an impedance of 110 Ohms. If connected to a source that matches this impedance, the above formula shows a loss of -6.0 dB. Even though there is maximum power transfer, there is a loss. This is called load loss and there's no way to avoid it. For example, using a higher source impedance, say 600 Ohms, the power loss becomes -8.8 dB. This is nearly 3 dB lower than before; -3 dB represents half the power. Using a lower source impedance, say 16 Ohms, the power loss is 9.5 dB. Note that the load loss increases if the source impedance is higher or is lower than the exact earphone impedance. Figure #1 shows the power loss for different earphones driven by different source impedances.In most cases, load loss is not critical. A headphone amplifier typically can deliver far more power than needed, thus overcoming the effect of unmatched impedances.Figure #1. Power loss at different source impedances for different earphones.SensitivitySensitivity is how effectively an earphone converts an electrical signal into an acoustical signal. Sensitivity indicates how loud the earphones will be for a given level from the source.This measurement is given in decibels of Sound Pressure Level per milliwatt, or dB SPL/mW. In some cases it might be shown as dB/mW and is based on a 1 mW input signal. One mW is one thousandths of a Watt, or 0.001 Watts. The sensitivity of earphones is usually in the range of 80 to 125 dB SPL/mW. Here is an example. An earphone's sensitivity is 122 dB SPL/mW. This means 1 mW of power will generate 122 dB SPL. This SPL level is over the threshold of pain and can cause permanent hearing damage in a short amount of time. Figure #2 shows different levels in dB SPL and the exposure time before hearing damage may occur. A typical headphone output could provide this level. Note that dB SPL do not sum in a linear manner; 2 mW into the earphone will not generate 244 dB SPL. Doubling or halving the input power increases or decreases the SPL by 3 dB. A .5 mW input into the earphone will generate 119 dB SPL. A sensitivity rating doesnt mean much until it is matched with the output capabilities of an audio system. If a system has low output level, using a low sensitivity earphone will result in low SPL. Increasing the amplifier level in this configuration will lead to distorted audio due to amplifier clipping. On the other hand, a high sensitivity earphone coupled with a high power headphone amplifier will force a low volume setting, and than can result in more noise. A classic case of this problem is connecting a pair ofefficient earhonesto an airplane sound system. Setting the volume at the first position, right above zero, gives enough level but is noisy. Increasing the volume makes it too loud to use. A simple, passive headphone attenuator solves this problem by reducing the level being delivered to the headphones, allowing you to raise the volume of the headphone amplifier to a setting that produces less noise. The following table shows the SPL output level for the different earphones at different source levels.Input power (mW)Earphone #1113.5 dB SPL/mWEarphone #2105 dB SPL/mWEarphone #3122 dB SPL/mW0.1 103.5 95.0 112.00.2 106.5 98.0 115.00.5 110.5 102.0 119.00.8 112.5 104.0 121.01.0 113.5 105.0 122.01.2 114.3 105.8 122.81.5 115.3 106.8 123.8Frequency ResponseWhen the frequency response is given as a graph, it indicates two different measurements. One, it shows the range of frequencies, lowest to highest, reproduced by the earphone. Two, it shows the relative output level of the earphone at each frequency. Frequency response is measured in Hertz (Hz) and covers the audible range between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Measuring frequency response in earphones is not a simple task. It requires the use of a \"dummy head\". The dummy head resembles a human head and has a measurement microphone inside each ear canal. Proper measurement of headphone frequency response is straightforward as the headphones are placed over the dummy ears. Measuring earphones is a different matter. When proper earphone placement is achieved, the ear canal becomes part of the earphone and affects the frequency response. Since each person has a different ear canal (depth, diameter, curvature, etc.) the frequency response will vary. In fact, it is likely that frequency response will vary between both ears of the same person. Therefore, a frequency response graph for earphones created using a dummy head is not a meaningful measurement.Clipping Level or Maximum LevelEarphone specifications rarely show clipping level or maximum input level. However, the audio source equipment might show this specification for the headphone output. In this case it will indicate the level at which the headphone amplifier begins to clip and the audio signal becomes noticeably distorted. Depending on the impedance and sensitivity of the earphones connected, this might be important. If sensitivity is low and/or the earphone impedance is significantly different than the source impedance, a high level output might be needed to compensate for the load loss and to get usable sound pressure level. If the required level is above the maximum output level of the headphone amplifier, the audio signal will be distorted and may cause damage to the earphones. Using an external battery operated headphone amplifier may solve this problem."}

{"prompt":"What kind of audible noise problems can be caused by an audio cable?","completion":"Audio system performance will be degraded due to any undesirable and interfering voltage (developed within or external to the audio system) which evidences itself as \"electrical noise\". By using the proper cable type with proven grounding and isolation techniques it is often possible to stop the noise before it enters the audio system. Audio (and video) cables are extremely sensitive to electromagnetic induction (EMI), electrostatic coupling, radio frequency interference (RFI) and changes in capacitance. Cables must be designed and manufactured to eliminate or minimize the factors which contribute to unwanted line noise, electrostatic hum, crosstalk, and noise induced by cable handling.Electro-Magnetic Induction (EMI)Electrons in motion create magnetic fields. Sources of these fields can be power cables, motors, power transformers, fluorescent light ballasts and SCRs as dimmers. These magnetic fields, and the resultant changes from constantly varying voltages, can induce a voltage in neighboring conductors which is heard as a buzz or hum. Twisting a cable's inner conductors minimizes susceptibility to this phenomena. Where there are multiple conductor pairs twisting them with varying \"lays\" so the fields do not align also minimizes EMI.Electrostatic HumIn an AC circuit, hum results from voltage being electrostatically coupled into the cable due to the capacitive reactance inherent between power and audio signal lines. The higher the capacitive reactance and the higher the impedance, the higher the induced noise. Additionally, the longer the cable run, the more susceptible the cable will be to hum. A properly grounded cable shield can eliminate this noise and the effectivity is proportional to the cable shield's coverage. Braid shield can provide up to 95% coverage. Foil shields can provide up to 100% coverage. When the utmost in cable flexibility is required a spirally served shield with multiple strands of fine wire can be used. Foil/tape shields do not have the flexibility of braid or spiral shields, and have a tendency to open under severe or multiple bending cycles. It is for this reason that foil shield cables are not typically chosen for microphone or instrument applications which require portability and movement. When 100% coverage is called for, as in digital broadcasting applications, double braids or a combination of foil/tape and braid can be utilized. As mentioned, the longer the cable, the more critical the shielding becomes.Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)Complex audio systems use a vast collection of equipment, all operating at different voltage levels and frequencies. Some of this equipment may radiate stray radio waves. Cables, which act like transmitting antennas, propagate this radiation. Cables are also receiving antennas and can contribute to the noise problem evidenced by buzz or hum. Properly grounded cable shielding greatly minimizes this problem. Cables are available with foil/tape shields, braid shields, spiral shields, and combinations of the shield types. All have their specific advantages and cost considerations so should be selected based on exact application.Handling NoiseThis source of noise is induced as a result of changes in capacitance. When cables are bent, subjected to vibration, impacted, or crushed, the distance between conductors or between conductors and shields is changed. This results in a change of capacitance between conductors and that leads to changes in the voltage difference between conductors. A change in voltage will induce noise into the cable. Cables can be constructed with fillers where to give the cables strength, mechanical stability, and durability.StaticNoise can be induced by the static build-up of electrons as a result of cables rubbing against each other or being dragged along carpets. The use of insulating material inside the cable shields can dissipate static noise, improve shield density, and further reduce noise inherent in normal handling.Ground LoopsWhen a cable connecting two pieces of audio equipment is grounded at both ends, buzz or hum can be created by undesirable current flow in the cable shield. The cable provides a ground path that is in addition to the hard wired AC power line grounds. This condition is called a ground loop. The resulting electrical potential differences lead to the undesirable current flow that causes hum. In severe cases the ground loop provides a return path for very high frequency internal equipment oscillation and this can cause audible distortion. A ground loop can often be eliminated by disconnecting the shield at one end of the cable. Note: never disconnect the shield on a cable used to connect a microphone to a mixer or other equipment.CrosstalkCrosstalk is when signals enter adjacent channels of multi-conductor cables by capacitive coupling or electromagnetic induction. Shielding each channel signal path and inserting twists in the conductors will minimize crosstalk. In higher impedance applications, e.g. digital audio applications, \"Star Quad\" cable construction will reduce induced noise levels.Source:  U.S. website of Draka Comteq"}
{"prompt":"Is there an analogy between signal to noise ratio at a loud party and the operation of a wireless microphone or a wireless PSM system?","completion":"Yes, indeed there is. Please read below:Conversation at a Loud Party…and Wireless MicrophonesRecently, I arrived early for a party. The host was working in the kitchen 20 feet from where I stood. \"Have a seat and I will tell you what's been going on,\" she said. I settled into a nearby comfy chair and we chatted. The house was quiet and it was no problem to converse even though the talker/transmitter (the host) was located 20 feet from the listener/receiver (me).Later that evening, the house was filled with guests when the host decided to continue the earlier conversation. But to hear each other we had to be one foot apart…the talker/transmitter had to be much closer to the listener/receiver. What changed?The answer: the ambient (background) noise level had increased due to the many conversations in the room. For me, the host's voice was the signal that I wanted to hear. All other sounds were noise, because these were signals that did not interest me. Yet when I arrived at the party and the noise level was quite low, I could be 20 feet away and still have a conversation.This is a practical demonstration of Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The signal is the voice of the host; the noise is everything else. The noise is uncorrelated (random) acoustical debris. If the level of the noise is greater than the level of the signal, I cannot understand what is being said. Everyone has experienced a poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio at a party, or a rock concert, or sporting event. Noise creates an acoustical fog that makes it difficult, or impossible, to understand what is being said.Here is a related question: Why might a Shure wireless mic system work properly over a distance of 500 feet in the Utah desert, while the same exact Shure wireless system will work properly for only 50 feet in New York City? As the wireless mic system did not change, what did?The answer: the ambient (background) RF (Radio Frequency) noise level increased due to the many sources of RF transmission in New York City. Examples are numerous TV station transmitters, two-way radio signals, broadcast radio signals, Wi-Fi, data networks, plus the ubiquitous smartphone, owned by every New Yorker and consistently in use. These signals are uncorrelated waves of electro-magnetic debris. Even though most of these RF noise sources do not operate on the same frequency as the Shure wireless system, these sources raise the level of the RF garbage. This makes it more difficult for the Shure transmitter (talker) to be heard by the Shure receiver (listener). Just like what happened at the party, the receiver has a tough time sorting out the desired transmitter signal from the undesired noise.In an environment with a high level of RF noise, the receiver (or the receiver antennas) must be located closer to the transmitter. This improves the RF Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The receiver then can pick up the desired transmitter because the signal is now stronger than the noise.A wireless receiver can be made more selective (improved ability to sort out the signal from the noise) by adding \"front-end RF filters.\" Located after the antennas, these filters reduce the level of RF noise sent into the receiver. Effective RF filters are expensive thus they are primarily found on higher priced wireless systems."}

{"prompt":"What are IP Addresses and Subnet Masks?","completion":"IP Addresses and Subnets can be confusing at times, especially when using IP Address ranges which are less common. This guide will help you understand how IP Addresses and Subnet Masks work, and we offer some recommended settings. This guide only discusses IPv4 addresses. Shure devices do not support IPv6 at this time.What is an IP Address?An IP Address is a unique address for a device which sends and receives network traffic on a network. Some devices may have more than one IP Address, because they have multiple internal components which need to communicate, or because they need to operate on multiple networks at the same time.An IP Address consists of four numbers called octets that are separated by periods. Each number can range from 0 to 255. An example of an IP Address is: 192.168.1.20.There are four very common ranges of IP addresses which are used for private networks. These addresses cannot be accessed over the Internet, and so are suitable for AV networks. If you are not sure what range of addresses to use, you should use one of these:192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (65,536 possible IP addresses)172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0 (1,048,576 possible IP addresses)10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (16,777,216 possible IP addresses)169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255* (65,536 possible IP addresses)Note: The last range, 169.254.x.x, is a special IP address range that is reserved for devices to self-assign an address. You generally do not manually assign addresses in this range, and they are not \"handed out\" by a switch, device, or server. Devices give themselves an address in this range when no DHCP server is present and a static IP address is not configured.There are some additional IP Addresses and ranges of IP Addresses you should be aware of:0.0.0.0: No IP Address. This is sometimes entered in the Gateway field when you want a network to be isolated. See the section on Subnets and Gateways below.127.0.0.1 (and 127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255): This address always sends data back to the device that sent it. It's sometimes called localhost or a loopback address. Do not ever assign an address beginning with 127 to a device.224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255: These are Multicast IP Addresses. See Multicast and IGMP In Depth for more information on Multicast IP traffic. You can't assign these addresses to a device as they are not valid device addresses.Any other address range not mentioned: other IP addresses should be assumed to be part of an enterprise network which is connected to the public Internet. Do not use those addresses unless your IT department directs you to do so.Subnet MasksA Subnet Mask defines which range of IP Addresses are within a local network, and which ones are not. Subnet masks always work from left to right. Devices are said to be within the same subnet if their IP Address starts with the same digits, but ends with a different set of digits.Sometimes, it's easy to tell which part of an IP address is part of the local network and which is not (when the subnet mask consists only sections that are 255 and 0), but sometimes it may not be as clear.Example IP Address 192.168.1.20Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0Starting Address in Subnet 192.168.1.0Ending Address in Subnet 192.168.1.255    Example IP Address 192.168.1.20Subnet Mask 255.255.0.0Starting Address in Subnet 192.168.0.0Ending Address in Subnet 192.168.255.255    Example IP Address 192.168.1.20Subnet Mask 255.0.0.0Starting Address in Subnet 192.0.0.0Ending Address in Subnet 192.255.255.255If the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then the first three octets of all devices must be the same. The 4th octet must be different and unique. A maximum of 254 devices can be used in this subnet.If the subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, then the first two octets of all devices must be the same. The combination of the last two octets must be different and unique. 65,534 devices can be used in this subnet.The very first address and very last address in a subnet are specially reserved addresses and cannot be assigned to devices. Devices that are within the same subnet will be able to communicate with one another, but a gateway is required to communicate with devices in different subnets.Gateways (or Routers)When traffic is intended for a device outside of the subnet, it is sent to the gateway to be routed to the correct destination. The gateway is a device on the network which has multiple networks configured. For example, a gateway on a home network generally sees the local network (e.g., 192.168.0.x) as well as the ISP (Internet Service Provider) network. The gateway takes local traffic for the internet and sends it along to the ISP, and then sends the response back to the device that originally sent the request.Devices on isolated networks, such as AV networks which do not connect to the Internet) should not have a gateway assigned. This can cause unexpected behavior because devices may attempt to contact the non-existent gateway. If the field must be filled in, enter 0.0.0.0.Recommended SettingsGenerally, we recommend you set your devices for Automatic or DHCP mode. A DHCP server on the network isn't required, but it is fine if one is present. For Dante-enabled devices, both the Shure Control and Network Audio addresses should be set to Automatic or DHCP (don't set one to Static and the other to Automatic).If a DHCP server is present, devices will get an IP Address in the DHCP range like 192.168.1.x.If no DHCP server is present, devices will get an IP address in the 169.254.x.x range with a 255.255.0.0 subnet mask. This is perfectly fine.Static IP AddressesIf you must use static IP addresses for your network, be sure that both Shure Control and Network Audio address for all devices are within the same subnet, and that all devices have unique IP addresses. We recommend that you maintain a list of all IP addresses in use to avoid conflicts. Do not assign a gateway address if there is no internet connection.Separating TrafficIn some cases, it is desired to separate Dante traffic from Control traffic. This can be done with some Shure devices which have multiple Ethernet ports by setting them to the Split mode. However, it is not possible to just configure IP addresses in different ranges in an attempt to separate traffic on the same switch or VLAN. This can lead to a number of issues, including devices which cannot communicate with one another, and will not prevent multicast and broadcast traffic from reaching undesired destinations in many situations."}
{"prompt":"Can I route audio from an MXWAPT or MXA910 directly to a Biamp Tesira, QSC Core, or other third-party DSP which supports Dante or AES67?","completion":"Yes, you can route audio from an MXWAPT or MXA910 or other Shure Dante-enabled devices to a DSP which supports Dante or AES67 without converting the audio to analog first.IMPORTANT: If one or more MXWAPT devices are present on the network, an MXWAPT must be the Primary Leader Clock. To select the MXW systems as the Leader Clock, ensure that all MXWAPT devices are selected as Preferred Leader on the Clock Status tab in Dante Controller. It is OK to select multiple MXWAPT's as the Preferred Leader—the devices will elect one and only one device as the Leader Clock. This applies for both Dante and AES67 networks.In some cases, some DSP's won't allow you to un-select them as the Leader Clock. Please see product-specific instructions below.Dante NetworksFollow these steps to route Shure Dante-enabled devices to a Dante-enabled third-party DSP:Update all devices on the network to the latest firmware or software provided by their manufacturer.Configure your switch for the network according to Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67.Ensure that all Shure devices are configured with both a Control and Network Audio address in the same subnet.Ensure that the third-party DSP's Dante card is configured to be in the same subnet as the Shure devices. Consult the documentation that came with your device for instructions.Verify that all devices appear in Dante Controller, and that the Leader Clock is set correctly.

If the AES67 tab does not appear, you can troubleshoot it with Why does the AES67 tab not show up in Dante Controller?Configure your DSP to receive the AES67 streams according to the manufacturer's instructions.Verify that audio is present on your DSP.Notes for Biamp Tesira InstallationsIn some cases, Tesira devices will not allow you to unselect them from being a Preferred Leader in Dante Controller. This occurs when you have a SERVER-IO with both AVB and Dante cards. In this situation, the Tesira locks out user control of this setting so as not to break clock propagation between AVB and Dante (or CobraNet, if you’re using that).The way to change clock priority is to go to the Media Networks dialog: System > Media Networks > Setup in the Tesira software. Set the Tesira to clock from the Dante network, and this will clear the Preferred Leader flag in Dante Controller and configure the Tesira to sync to the Dante clock (including the AVB card).Note that this dialog is telling Tesira on which network the Leading Clock will be, which is why it might appear to work backwards at first glance. It tells Tesira that it must sync to the incoming Dante clock and push that clock onto any connected AVB or CobraNet networks.See these documents for more information:https://support.biamp.com/Tesira/Miscellaneous/Tesira_release_noteshttps://support.biamp.com/Tesira/Control/Using_multiple_networked_audio_protocolsNotes for QSC Core InstallationsIf you followed QSC guides to configure your network switch, you may need to make some adjustments to the switch configuration to make devices appear correctly.

{"prompt":"I use Shure recharegeable batteries in my wireless mics, and I don't plan on using them for several months. Do you have any suggestions to help make sure my batteries will still be functional the next time I need to use them? ","completion":"To help ensure your batteries are good to go the next time you need them, here are some helpful pointers to help prevent your Lithium Ion batteries from discharging to a point where they can't be recovered: 1.    Manage Charge Status  As available for your rechargeable product batteries, use Storage Mode.  When Shure rechargeable batteries will not be used for extended periods of time, Storage Mode will leave the battery in a slightly depleted state that is optimal for long-term storage.   If your charger does not support Storage mode, then charge the batteries to full as you normally would. Under no circumstance would you want to store batteries that have been fully discharged.  2.    Store Batteries Separately Removable batteries should be taken out of any charger or device when storing for extended periods.  If the battery is built into the device, then make sure any switches or power are set to off.  3.    Store at Room Temperature Batteries should be stored in a controlled, room temperature environment, so the temperature remains relatively steady.  Normal HVAC with a thermostat is perfectly adequate.    Large temperature fluctuations, or extreme hot or cold storage, will speed up and increase the aging of a lithium-ion battery. 4.    Long-term StorageIf rechargeable batteries need to be stored for longer than one week, we highly recommend that they be recharged every six months using your Shure charger’s Storage Mode feature.  If Storage Mode is not an option, recharging to full is an acceptable solution.  As a general rule, remove lithium-ion-powered devices and batteries when fully charged and store outside the charger for best lithium-ion battery health.  Note: while these techniques can help maintain battery life, lithium-ion batteries do age and degrade over time.These guidelines are intended as a general explanation of how to handle Shure lithium-ion batteries.  Always reference Shure product user guide and supporting documentation, and any applicable health and safety regulations, for any specific handling instructions.Quick hits:- Do not store batteries that are totally discharged!- Long term storage should use Storage Mode and should be checked and/or recharged every 6 months.

{"prompt":"If I need to select a network switch for a Dante or AES67 network with Shure devices, which switches are recommended?","completion":"While we do not specifically certify or recommend particular models of switches, customers have reported that the Netgear M4250 Series, Cisco SG350 series, and D-Link DGS-1210 series of switches generally work very well for smaller, isolated networks. See Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 for switch-specific configuration guides.If you are connecting or uplinking to a campus, corporate, or enterprise network, we highly recommend bringing all equipment back to the IDF and connecting to enterprise-grade access-layer switches. We also recommend that your VLANs do not span across buildings and that their IPv4 Subnet Mask is /24 (255.255.255.0; total of 254 IP addresses) or smaller. See our Enterprise Network Troubleshooting Checklist for more details.Here are some additional tips for selecting a switch:Avoid switches on our list of Disqualified Network Switches for Shure Dante Devices.A Gigabit switch is recommended especially for connections between devices sending Audio over IP in the system. Examples of such devices are Microflex Wireless components (MXWAPT, MXWANI), Microflex Advance products (MXA910, MXA710, MXA310), Audio Processors (P300-IMX, IntelliMix Room), and Audio Interfaces (ANI devices).Generally, a managed switch that has a built-in graphical user interface is preferred because it will allow you to turn on or off any features that could affect performance of the system and network.The switch should support DSCP, often referred to as QoS (Quality of Service). Generally, this protocol is turned on but may need to be manually configured depending on the network topology or settings.  If you are unsure about this, you may need to contact the IT department or network administrator that is responsible for the network.Avoid switches that employ the 802.3az protocol, otherwise referred to as Energy Efficient Ethernet, or select a managed switch that will allow you to turn this feature OFF even if the switch employs. This feature is intended to conserve energy by putting currently unused ports into a \"sleep\" state. This kind of operation can cause interruptions in Dante and AES67 clocking, which will lead to dropouts. This is particularly problematic for systems involving multiple Microflex Wireless Access Points.If you intend to connect an MXA910, MXA710, MXA310, ANI4IN, ANI4OUT, ANI22, or MXWAPT to a switch directly, that switch will need to have ports that supply PoE (Power over Ethernet). The power requirement for each most devices is 6.5W (Class 0 PoE). A Shure P300 requires a PoE+ capable switch."}
{"prompt":"Why does the MXWAPT have \"Sync to External\" checked in Dante Controller?","completion":"The Dante Controller column labels are from the perspective of the Dante FPGA living inside the Shure device circuitry. The APT has a high stability clock that feeds the Dante FPGA with the 'golden' time reference for its network clock. To the Dante FPGA, it's 'external' and in controller they label it as such.It's also the reason why we say \"you have to use the MXWAPT as the Dante clock Primary Leader\" because we know our clock has high enough stability to guarantee our DECT transmit timing coordination between MXWAPTs. The Primary Leader clock MXWAPT essentially derives the DECT timing off the high stability. The other MXWAPTs utilize the incoming Dante clock timing off the network to keep the DECT transmit timing synced. "}

{"prompt":"I recently added PSM transmitter to my wireless rack, and now my wireless microphones are dropping out. How do I fix it?","completion":"Here's a common story: a customer purchases a Shure PSM (Personal Stereo Monitor) system and installs the PSM transmitter in the equipment rack next to a Shure wireless mic receiver. At the rear of the rack, the PSM transmit antenna is six inches away from the wireless mic receive antennas. Or, all of the equipment have their antennas mounted on the front of the rack, inches away from one another. When the PSM transmitter is operating, the wireless mic system becomes unreliable, exhibiting numerous drop-outs. Power off the PSM transmitter and the wireless mic operates just fine.Now here is the rub: it is not a frequency issue. The frequencies were properly coordinated to avoid interference between the units. So what is the root cause? It's called Desensitization, or Desense. An analogy will explain.You are sitting in a dark room and your eyes have adjusted to the darkness. In the far corner, there is a nightlight with a very low wattage light bulb. You can easily see the glow emitted from the nightlight. Suddenly, a bright ceiling light is switched on and then off. For some time, you can no longer see the nightlight glow because your eyes have been \"de-sensitized\" by the bright light.The dim nightlight is the wireless mic transmitter. Your eyes are the wireless mic receiver. The bright ceiling light is the PSM transmitter. Because the PSM transmit antenna is very close to the wireless mic receive antennas, the wireless mic receiver is overloaded (or swamped) by the strong PSM signal. The wireless mic receiver can no longer \"see\" the tiny signal coming in from the its transmitter. The receiver has been de-sensitized by the strong PSM signal, just like your eyes were de-sensitized by the bright ceiling light.How much stronger is the PSM signal because of its proximate position to the wireless mic receiver? Let's assume that the mic transmitter and the PSM transmitter are emitting the same signal strength. However, the wireless mic transmit antenna is 20 feet away from the receiving antennas, while the PSM transmit antenna is 0.5 feet away. This difference in distance provides a difference in signal level of over 30 dB! The wireless mic receiver is being \"blinded\" by the strong signal from the neighboring PSM transmitter.The solution is to separate the PSM transmit antenna from the wireless mic receive antennas. But how great must the separation be? There is no hard and fast rule. The answer is \"farther is better.\"  As a starting point, ten to fifteen feet (three to five meters) of separation is suggested. If you have multiple PSM units, it can be helpful to combine their signal with a PA411 (for PSM300) or a PA421B or PA821B (PSM900/PSM1000), and then mount a PA805SWB antenna on a mic stand 10-15 feet away. In this situation, all of the equipment can live in the same rack because the transmit antenna is separated.Though it may be convenient to mount a PSM transmitter in the same rack as the wireless mic receiver, it is not best practice. The PSM transmit antenna and the wireless mic receive antennas will be too close for comfort."}
{"prompt":"What are the differences between AONIC FREE and AONIC 215 True Wireless (2nd Generation)?","completion":"While the AONIC FREE and the AONIC 215 are both True Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones developed by Shure, they differ in a few key areas – particularly in design. AONIC 215: The AONIC 215 features a detachable MMCX connection, which enables a user to convert to a wired connection with a separately available accessory (RMCE-UNI).   This model also features an over-ear hook design with button controls behind the ear and is IPX4-rated for sweat and water resistance.   The carrying case is a zippered, round style and provides 3 additional charges for a total of up to 32 hours battery life. This model comes in two colors (black and blue). If you are looking for the most secure fit and water resistance, prioritize using earphones for working out, or like the idea of being able to go from wireless to wired or switch other Shure MMCX earphones to wireless, then the AONIC 215 may be best for you.  AONIC FREE: In contrast, the AONIC FREE has a sleek, hook-free design with the button controls at the top of the earbud.  The overall design of the AONIC FREE is more compact, with a slimmer and more portable charging case that slips right into your pocket.     The charging case has a flip-top closure and provides 2 additional charges for a total of up to 21 hours battery life.  If you prefer a hook-free design and prioritize portability and pocketable design over the convenience of being able to convert to a wired connection, than the AONIC FREE may be best for you. Shared features for BOTH include: Clear, studio-quality audio. Engineered from decades of experience supporting music legends. Sound Isolating™ technology blocks up to 37 dB of noise to eliminate distractions. Enjoy the most immersive listening experience no matter where you are. Environment Mode:  Hear the outside world with the touch of a button. Stereo calls with call mute activation directly on earphones Customizable Hardware EQ: Choose from multiple presets, or create your own custom EQ and load it to your earphones using the PLAY app. Volume control that is adjustable directly on the earphones. Customizable button configuration for personalization of volume, playback and voice/tone prompts.  Role switching capabilities enable use of left or right independently. Auto Power On so earphones power on automatically out of the case. PausePlus function: Automatically turn on Environment Mode to hear the outside world when you pause your music from your earphones.  Customize your earphone prompts (voice and tones) within the ShurePlus PLAY app: Select the language, turn the volume up or down, or opt to turn some off entirely.  "}
{"prompt":"What are the differences between the new, second-generation of the AONIC 215 True Wireless Earphones/the True Wireless Adapter and the first-generation versions?  ","completion":"There are several areas of feature updates for the second generation, including:   Phone call enhancements: The new TW2 now has stereo calls (call audio in both ears).  Additionally, users can now activate call mute or turn it off directly on the earphones. Volume control is now adjustable directly on earphones Customizable button configuration enables personalization of volume, playback and call controls.  Role switching capabilities enable use left or right independently  IPX4 Water Resistance for enhanced durability and sweat protection Customizable Hardware EQ: Choose from multiple presets, or create your own custom EQ and load it to your earphones using the PLAY app Auto Power On: Earphones power on automatically out of the case. PausePlus function: Automatically turn on Environment Mode to hear the outside world when you pause your music from your earphones. This feature is particularly useful when you want to hear something without having to take your earphones out. For example, while on-flight you’ll have the ability to quickly hear overhead announcements, or when being asked a question during your commute.  Customize your earphone prompts (voice and tones) within the ShurePlus PLAY app:  Select the language, turn the volume up or down, or opt to turn some off entirely. Please note: By design, certain prompts cannot be turned off, and events that occur when you touch the product — like Power On and Volume Max — will always play as tones to avoid interrupting your content.

{"prompt":"Is the MV7X compatible with the ShurePlus MOTIV app on mobile, or the Motiv Desktop App on Mac/PC?","completion":"No. The MV7X is a completely passive microphone. You will need an audio interface to use it with a phone or computer. The MV7X does not have any software adjustments, and does not require power. In fact, there are no computer chips inside. Many of the same advice in Getting Started with the SM7B applies to the MV7X as well."}
{"prompt":"What are some frequently asked questions about the Aonic FREE wireless earphones?","completion":"How do the buttons function on the True Wireless AONIC FREE? Single Press: Play/Pause (or Answer/End for Phone Calls) Double Press: Environment Mode, On or Off Triple Press: Summon Digital Assistant (Left Earphone) Single Press, then Hold: Volume Down (Right Earphone) Single Press, then Hold: Volume Up Triple Press (Either Earphone During Phone Call): Mute/Unmute Call Audio Mics What is “PausePlus”? This feature turns on Environment Mode when you pause music (Single Press) from the button on your earphone. When you resume music by performing another press, the Environment Mode is automatically disabled and the music resumes. You can activate this feature from the ShurePlus PLAY app. What drivers and audio technologies are used in the AONIC free? How does it differ from the existing Shure earphone line? The AONIC FREE uses a premium dynamic driver with excellent audio specs - low harmonic distortion, smooth extension, and a natural, balanced frequency response. But comparing drivers to existing models only tells a fraction of the story when it comes to the audio design of the AONIC FREE. While the choice of driver establishes a critical foundation, the mechanical enclosure and tuning of the audio path are all equally important to delivering the ultimate sound signature. On top of all that, the AONIC FREE sports a configurable EQ (set to Flat by default), which users can customize to match their preferred frequency response and save as a preset directly to the earphone.  What is Sound Isolating™ technology? Shure’s Sound Isolating technology naturally blocks up to 37dB of unwanted outside noise. Unlike Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Sound Isolation is a passive solution. This means that it does not require battery power and does not introduce any additional audio artifacts which can sometimes result from ANC processing. To bypass Sound Isolation, simply press twice on either earphone to activate Environment Mode. This will turn on the ambient mics when you need to be aware of your surroundings. For an even quicker bypass, select PausePlus from the PLAY app; this will pause your music and activate Environment Mode with a single press.  Can I customize the button functions on the AONIC FREE? Yes. You can use the ShurePlus PLAY app to customize your button functions. Will I hear Call Audio in both ears? Yes. Incoming call audio will be heard in both ears (stereo).  Can I use either the Left or Right earphone independently? Yes. Either side can be used for phone calls.  How long does the battery last? Up to 7 hours of battery life. The Included carrying case provides two additional charges for a total of up to 21 hours battery life. Standby time is about 35 hours (powered on but not in use).  How quickly can I recharge the earphones? Fifteen minutes of charge will get you about 1 hour of use.  90 minutes of charge gets you from 0% to 100% full battery.  How many charges are in the case? The included carrying case provides two additional charges for a total of up to 21 hours battery life.  If the battery is fully charged it will retain charge for up to a year.  How long does it take to recharge the case?  About two hours. How do I know if my earphones are being charged?  How do I know the earphones are inserted properly in the case?  For proper charging, insert the earphones into the case. The earphone LEDs will illuminate solid RED to indicate that they are being charged by the charging case. The earphone LEDs will turn off when charging is complete.  What does the light on the case do?  When not plugged in: GREEN means the case has enough battery to fully charge a set of earphones. RED means the case battery is too low to support a full charge of earphones. When plugged in: RED means the case is charging. GREEN means it is fully charged.  What do the earphone LEDs indicate? Flashing Blue and Red = Pairing Mode Flashing Red = Low Battery 1s Single Blue Flash = Power On 1s Single Red Flash = Power Off Solid Red LED when in case = Charging 1s Repeated Blue Flash = Link Loss (Primary adapter has lost contact with host) Solid Red during phone call = On A Call (configurable in PLAY app)How do I know which side is the Primary? (The Active Mic for Phone Calls) Although you hear call audio in both ears, only one side sends the audio from your end of a phone call. That side - known as the “Primary”  - is identified in the ShurePlus PLAY App. To configure which side is the Primary, choose the side you prefer for phone calls, and remove that side from the case first.    The first adapter that the phone/computer “sees” will become the Primary for that session only. That adapter will remain the Primary until any one of the following events occur: The unit is returned to the Charging Case.  The unit is powered OFF (via long-press of the adapter’s multi-function button). The unit goes out of RF range of the host (e.g., your phone or PC). The unit powers OFF automatically due to a Low Battery condition. When any of those events occur, the Secondary unit (if present) will take over from the Primary. The Mute tone (triple press during a call to active/deactivate) will only be heard in the Primary. How do I clear the PDL (Paired Device List)?  You can clear from the PLAY app or put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds.  How do I order replacement earphone sleeves? The AONIC Free are supplied with one set each of small, medium (attached), and large Comply™ 100 Series premium sound-isolating foam sleeves. Replacements may be ordered directly from Comply. Shure Black Foam Replacement Sleeves (EABKF1) are also compatible and may be ordered directly from Shure. How do I peer pair a replacement earphone? The peer pairing process wirelessly pairs one earphone to another so that they work as a set. To pair your new earphone to your old earphone, put both earphones in the charging case and hold down the buttons for 7 seconds, until the earphone LEDs begin flashing blue. If I lose a unit and receive a replacement, how do I pair it to my other adapter?  To peer pair, put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. This also clears the PDL. Once you have peer-paired the modules to each other, be sure to use the PLAY app to update the firmware so that the new and old earbuds are both running on the same firmware.  Why are my device settings “grayed out” in the PLAY app? Why can’t I change settings? If you are only using one earbud, you will not be able to change system settings like Pause Plus or Environment Mode. System changes are only allowed when both earbuds are “seen” by the host. Likewise, both earbuds must be on the same firmware version. If Right and Left are on different firmware versions, the PLAY app will disable any of the customization options.  If I lose the charging case and buy a new one, do I need to pair it with the earphones?  No. The new case will support the original earphones Why does it keep going into pairing mode?  If you manually Power ON either earphone (via a long-press of the earphone’s multi-function button), and continue pressing after you hear the “Power On” prompt, you will enter into Bluetooth Pairing Mode. It is important to release the button after you hear the “Power On” prompt unless you want to enter Bluetooth Pairing Mode.  How many microphones are there in the AONIC FREE earphones? There are two microphones on each earphone. On each there is one mic for Voice and one mic for Environment Mode. They work together in conjunction with DSP (“beamforming”) to improve voice intelligibility. What Bluetooth 5.0 profiles are supported?  A2DP 1.3.1, AVRCP 1.6, GAVDP 1.3, HFP 1.7.1, HSP 1.2  Does this product support role swapping? Yes. Either Left or Right side can be the Primary (the Primary unit is the side that “talks” to the phone). When you remove them from the case, the first one the phone “sees” will become the Primary. It will remain the Primary until you manually Power OFF, put it back in the Charging Case, or it goes out of range of the RF host, or the battery dies. If any of these events occur, the Secondary (if present) will automatically take over and become the Primary.  Is there Multipoint Pairing? Multipoint pairing is not supported.  How many devices can it store in memory?  Up to 8. The oldest will be overwritten by the newest. How do I reset to factory defaults? You can reset by using the ShurePlus PLAY app. Sometimes I hear a high-pitched “howling” when using Environment Mode. Environment Mode allows you to hear the outside world with the touch of a button. If you cup your eaphone in your hand while Environment Mode is On, the unit may produce feedback (howling). Sometimes this may cause the unit to shut down, but it will not damage the earphone.  Overload Shutdown An overload shutdown protects the battery circuit from damage. If you experience an overload shutdown it may be necessary to return units to the charging case before powering on again. Is AONIC FREE MS Teams Certified? AONIC Free is not UC or MS Teams certified.   In what situations does this earphone perform best? This product is designed for music listening and communication in any situation. It is great at home, in the office, on-the-go or at the gym. It works for listening to music, movies and podcasts, as well as for conferencing and phone calls. "}

{"prompt":"Is it possible to operate an MXCW640 delegate unit without the battery installed if using a standard USB charger?  Or is the battery required?","completion":"The answer is that you still definitely need a battery. The SB930 battery must be installed even if you want to plug the unit into external power. However, per the MXCW User Guide, the MXCW640 units require a micro USB cable that can supply at least 2 amps of current to the conference unit.  Regarding whether or not a battery is installed in the unit, if you attempt to plug in a charger while the battery is not installed and turn on the unit, you will see the following screen: Additionally, if you insert the battery while the screen above is displayed, the unit will not immediately revert to operational mode but instead, will show a battery charging screen:   To operate the MXCW640 properly with external power, please make certain to have the SB930 battery installed before you turn on the unit and plug in the charger. You can then power on the unit and, once it is booted up, you can plug in a USB charger that is capable of supplying 2A of current and the unit will continue to function while also slowly charging the battery.

{"prompt":"Can you please tell me the differences in the AXT610 and AD610 units?","completion":"Both the AXT610 and the AD610 Showlink Access Points are compatible with the Axient Analog (AXT) and Axient Digital (ADX) Transmitters. They can also coexist in a single system without issue but there are some differences between the two:The AD610 allows for both a standard and high RF power setting for potentially improved range while the AXT610 only had a fixed standard RF power (10 dBm ERP). The AD610 selectable power settings are:Normal (default) = Operates at 8 dBmHigh = Operates at 18 dBmEach AD610 can support up to 24 Axient transmitters at one time while each AXT610 was only able to support up to 16 Axient transmitters.The AD610 is a diversity access point (two antennas) which can improve reception especially in reflective and/or congested RF environments. In comparison, the original AXT610 was a non-diversity access point (one antenna). Both, though, still have a separate dedicated antenna for scanning and evaluating the environment.The AD610 allows for connection of the new ADX5D dual camera slot portable receiver to a ShowLink network. However, the AXT610 is NOT compatible with the ADX5D in any way."}

{"prompt":"How do I troubleshoot an Enterprise Network for audio?","completion":"Shure Network Audio Devices have a number of specific requirements in order to operate correctly. This FAQ is intended to help Enterprise Network Administrators ensure that Shure devices will fully function on their networks.Overview of Network Requirements and Assumptions for Network Audio DevicesNetwork audio devices, such as Shure products with Dante, behave differently than other media-over-IP solutions such as IPTV, multicast video, and streaming audio. Because audio is sent in real-time, low latency and low jitter are required for solid and reliable performance. Additionally, multicast traffic is used for control traffic and clocking, and in some cases for audio data transport as well.This guide walks through the various recommendations and requirements to make your network audio deployment successful. Physical Layer and Network TopologyGenerally, Shure devices expect to all be on the same VLAN and to be able to communicate between each other and management computers using multicast traffic. You will generally get the best performance if all devices are plugged into the same physical switch or switch stack.If your device network/VLAN has segments which pass through a layer 3 router or a firewall, unexpected behaviour may result. If you run into issues, simplify your network to one switch and check for functionality, then slowly introduce more complexity.We generally recommend that all switches be from the same manufacturer and the same line of products. Mixed-vendor networks can present problems. We do not recommend mixing \"small-business\" switches with enterprise-grade switches.Shure devices expect all links within the network to be symmetric (in terms of bandwidth, transit time, and jitter). Normal copper and fiber Ethernet links are almost always fine. Technologies such as MPLS, Metro Ethernet, GPON, BPON, and MoCA may violate these assumptions. Traffic shaping should be disabled (see QoS below for more).Ensure uplink ports are of sufficient bandwidth to carry all multicast media streams present on the network. On networks with video, this may mean using 10 Gbps+ links.Be careful when configuring LAGs to ensure that all components of the lag have identical latency and performance.Always use a cable certifier to ensure all cables are terminated correctly and will be error-free.Most Shure devices support Gigabit networks, including all Dante-enabled devices. Some devices, such as chargers, are 10/100 Ethernet (\"Fast Ethernet\"). We highly recommend all devices be connected to Gigabit switchports regardless of device.Device Addressing, Port Security, and AuthenticationShure Dante-enabled devices contain two Ethernet devices internally with separate MAC addresses, and require two IP addresses.For Shure devices with a single Ethernet port, we require that both the Control and Network Audio interfaces be in the same VLAN and within the same subnet.We do not support VLAN Tagging (802.1q) on any Shure products.Products with Ultimo and UltimoX chipsets will not permit firmware updates if the two NICs are configured in different subnets.For Shure devices with multiple network ports (excluding MXWANI), you may elect to separate the Shure Control and Dante traffic if you would prefer to do so. This is a configurable option on the device; see the User's Guide for more information.Shure devices respond to DHCP out of the box and after factory reset, and will self-assign an IP address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range if no DHCP server is present. There is no hard-coded default address.We recommend DHCP with address reservations for most users. Static address assignment is discouraged due to the potential for accidentally entering duplicate IP addresses.If using switchport security on your switches, ensure that multiple MAC Addresses are permitted on a single switchport.If you are using MAC address authentication with Cisco switches, you may need to configure your switch for authentication host-mode multi-host or multi-auth rather than multi-domain or single-host for Shure devices with two MAC addresses.Shure devices do not support 802.1x authentication.Shure devices will not register a hostname with the DHCP server (option 12) for the Shure Control interface. This is expected behavior. The Dante interface will register a hostname.Shure devices don't require a DNS server to be configured.Pro tip: Shure MAC Addresses generally begin with 00:0E:DD.Shure Device Discovery and UpdatesEnsure you are running the latest version of Shure Update Utility and Shure Designer.If devices do not appear, follow this FAQ first: Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't Display.Shure devices use both Shure Discovery and Bonjour (mDNS) for discovery. Dante uses Bonjour (mDNS) exclusively.Shure Discovery is on multicast address 239.255.254.253:8427.Bonjour/mDNS is on multicast address 224.0.0.251:5353.NOTE: Some switches have an mDNS Capture/Propagation feature, which when enabled can \"capture\" all mDNS traffic for the purpose of flooding it out. This feature generally needs to be disabled so that the switch does not attempt to block/capture the mDNS traffic. If devices do not appear in Dante Controller or Shure Web Device Discovery, this may be the reason.Inter-device communication is via unicast UDP traffic, and on a randomly-assigned UDP port per device.Shure Designer, Shure Update Utility, and Wireless Workbench permit management of devices across VLANs (\"Remote Devices\"). This allows you to manage and update an entire campus from one location. Communication is via unicast UDP, and we expect no packet filtering between VLANs. NAT is not supported due to the UDP sessions.Updates can only be installed with Shure Update Utility or Shure Designer. There is no web page upload option. Download firmware through these programs.Shure Update Utility needs to be bonded to a specific NIC on a computer, and must be allowed through the PC's Firewall.Multicast SettingsMulticast is used for control traffic and audio clocking, even if multicast audio streams are not used.Ensure IGMP Snooping is enabled on your switch for the VLAN with Shure devices. Enterprise networks should have IGMP enabled; running without IGMP snooping is only advised for small networks with a single switch and no AES67 or Dante multicast audio streams.One switch must serve as the IGMP Querier. This is often automatically elected in homogeneous switch environments. The core switch is the preferred querier.The Querier generally needs to have an IP address in the same Layer 3 subnet as the Shure devices. Some switches have workarounds for this requirement; contact your switch manufacturer for more details.All other switches should see the switch with the querier as their mrouter, and the port headed to that switch as an mrouter port.We recommend a querier interval of 30s or less to minimize long outages when the IGMP Snooping table must be rebuilt.Verify that the following multicast groups are present in the multicast forwarding database and not blocked by any ACL:Dante Control Traffic: 224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233 (Dante Cards and Dante Controller - may not be registered via IGMP; we expect these to flood the subnet)Bonjour/mDNS: 224.0.0.251:5353 (Shure Web Device Discovery, Dante Controller - may not be registered via IGMP; we expect these to flood the subnet)PTP Clock: 224.0.1.129:319-320 (Dante Cards - should register with IGMP)Shure Discovery: 239.255.254.253:8427 (Shure Update Utility, Designer, SystemOn, Wireless Workbench - should register with IGMP)SAP (AES67): 239.255.255.255:9875 (AES67 Announcements - should register with IMGP)See Which network ports does Dante use? for additional information.NOTE: We expect traffic in the 224.0.0.0/24 range to flood the VLAN. Some networks do not always flood this traffic, especially in environments where a L2 VLAN spans multiple switches connected via a router. You may need to make adjustments to your switch or router to ensure this traffic floods, including manually adding required groups to the multicast forwarding database.Shure devices generally do not expect multicast to be routed across subnets. In networks where multicast is permitted to flow across VLANs, unexpected behaviour may occur. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if this is the case for your network.If a device is not seeing some multicast traffic, check the switch to ensure that switchport is joined to the correct multicast groups.In larger networks, where traffic must traverse a core switch from one edge switch to another, it may be necessary to enable PIM Sparse Mode on the core switch. Confer with your network engineering team before making this change.Ensure Multicast Storm Control is disabled on switchports that Shure devices are connected to.In some cases, customers may wish to block multicast traffic between switchports on the same VLAN. This is done sometimes when each room has its own small switch to create small multicast domains which do not flood the entire VLAN. In this case, you will not be able to remotely discover Shure devices from a central location. You will need to connect to the devices via IP Address from Designer, Shure Update Utility, or Wireless Workbench.QoS SettingsShure Network Audio devices assign DSCP values to traffic. You should configure your network to trust these values.Here are the recommend settings:DSCP 56 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the highest priority on the network.DSCP 46 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the second highest priority on the network.DSCP 34 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the third highest priority on the network.Ensure that trunk ports respect DSCP tags, even across VLANs. This is critical to ensure clock traffic timing is maintained.IMPORTANT: Shure devices which support DDM and are running Dante firmware 4.x use different QOS settings for AES67 compared to devices running Dante firmware 3.x.Dante 4.x: Clock is DSCP 46; Audio is DSCP 34 (matches AES67 standard).Dante 3.x: Clock is DSCP 56, Audio is DSCP 46 (matches Audinate standard).Clock Traffic (PTP)Clock traffic is the most important network traffic exchanged by Shure Network Audio devices.Clock traffic is in multicast group 224.0.1.129:319-320.Review the QOS notes above. There are differences between Dante firmware versions used in Shure devices.If multiple leader clocks are detected, this means that all devices are not seeing the PTP traffic, some packets are getting dropped, or that packets are being delayed excessively. Check multicast group membership for group 224.0.1.129 and check Multicast Storm Control. Ensure all devices appear fully in Dante Controller.If excessive jitter is detected, this means that QOS is not configured correctly. Verify clock traffic is in a dedicated queue with the highest priority, including on trunk and LAG interfaces.Ensure no devices are connected to an unmanaged switch which is connected to an enterprise switch. Some low-end switches employ low cost store-and-forward chipsets which are not compatible with network audio traffic.If your switches support PTPv2 E2E Transparent Clock, we recommend enabling it. Note that this only affects AES67 clocking. Dante clocking with PTPv1 does not support Transparent Clocks.Audio Traffic (RTP/RTSP)Review the QOS notes above. There are differences between Dante firmware versions used in Shure devices.If packets are lost or delayed, QOS may not be not configured correctly. Verify audio traffic is in a dedicated queue with the second highest priority, including on trunk and LAG interfaces. Also verify that there are no 100 Mbps switches or trunk ports on the network. Ensure uplinks are not saturated.AES67 streams are announced via SAP on multicast group 239.255.255.255:9875 Verify all devices are subscribed to this group.If devices cannot subscribe to Dante Multicast flows or AES67 flows,  this means that all devices are not able to join the AES67 group. Check multicast group membership for that group. Recreating the AES67 flow in Dante Controller may help."}
{"prompt":"I have a Shure wireless system and it is not loud enough. I have to hold the mic very close to my mouth and speak loudly. I can also hear audio if I scratch the mic grill. Do I need a different mic element?","completion":"The problem is not the mic element. The problem is a level mis-match between the wireless receiver output and the device to which it is connected. This scenario is common and the explanation is simple.The audio output level of many wireless mic systems is \"Mic level\". This means the output level is the equivalent of a wired microphone, like a Shure SM58. A typical Mic level output is 1 to 3 millivolts (mV). This Mic level signal cannot properly drive an input that requires Aux level (100 mV), or Line level (1,000 mV or 1 V). When you speak loudly into the mic and hold it close to your mouth, the audio output level increases dramatically, and the system then works as expected.The options are:Connect the wireless receiver into a Mic level input of the following device.  If the device has a selectable input, make certain the input is set to Mic level. If there is an input gain control, set it to Maximum.  If there is an input attenuator control, set it to Minimum/No Attenuation.If there is no Mic level input, connect the wireless receiver output into a Shure SCM268 or SCM262 mixer. The mixer will increase the audio level from Mic level to Aux level or to Line level. In place of the Shure mixer, use a device like the Radio Design Labs FP-MP1 Microphone Preamp.Helpful hint #1: A Mic level input is typically a female XLR connector. An Aux level or Line level input is typically an RCA jack, 1/4\" phone jack, or 3.5 mm phone jack. Please note that just because one connector mates properly with another does NOT mean that the levels match.What do typical audio connectors look like?Helpful hint #2: Substitute a wired mic, like a Shure SM58, for the wireless receiver. If the SM58 has the same \"low output\" complaint as above, then the device input is definitely Aux level or Line level.Helpful hint #3: Different wireless receivers have different output levels. This is true within the Shure line and with competitive brands. Consult the User Guide of each wireless receiver to determine its output signal level. Mic Level can vary as much as 20 dB between different receivers. On certain Shure receivers, the audio output level is 14 dB greater using the 1/4\" phone jack compared to the XLR.  Some wireless receivers have a Line / Mic switch near the XLR output.  Selecting Line will boost the output signal level significantly.Helpful hint #4:  The mic-to-mouth distance is a critical element of loudness. A lapel microphone, positioned on the chest, will never be as loud as a handheld microphone, positioned close to the mouth.  A lapel microphone, held close to the mouth, can be as loud as the handheld microphone. "}

{"prompt":"I've been researching the Beta 87A, and I'm getting ready to buy one. I checked out your web site and see the addition of the Beta 87C. Other than having a little bit higher of a frequency response, what is the MAIN difference? I mean, realistically, how (or) will the 87C benefit me over the 87A as a vocal mic?","completion":"The primary difference is the pick-up pattern. The BETA 87A is a supercardioid; the BETA 87C is a cardioid. The 87C was introduced for performers using in-ear monitors. In brief, a cardioid mic is often preferred by in-ear monitor users as it sounds more \"natural\" with the in-ear mix.If you use floor monitors, the BETA 87A may be a better choice as it will often provide a bit more gain before feedback than the BETA 87C. However, which model works better for you can only be decided via auditioning the mics.Both models require phantom power for operation."}
{"prompt":"Can I pole mount the MXA910? Does Shure offer a pole mount for it?","completion":"Yes, the MXA910 can be pole mounted.

{"prompt":"I'm new to the wireless scene and want to get a Shure system. Here's my question. I use multiple guitars on stage with a few different amps. What system do I need to accomplish wireless guitar for all this? Do I need a different unit for each guitar and amp? What if I want to use the same guitar but switch amps?","completion":"There are many ways to do this. (1) You could swap the transmitter to each guitar when you change guitars. (2) You could have a separate transmitter on each guitar that are all on the same frequency, but you would have to remember that only one of the transmitters could be on at any one time. (3) Have a separate transmitter and receiver on separate frequencies for every guitar and amplifier.Changing amplifiers would be more complicated. You would either have to unplug the receiver out of one amp and plug it into the other amp, or have separate receivers for each amp.Just remember that if you put everything on the same frequency, only one transmitter can be turned on at a time. But multiple receivers could be on. If you put everything on separate frequencies, then all the transmitters can be on at any time. So, depending on how you are going to use the systems, will depend on which is best for your scenario.Please see the following links to our online FAQ:Where can I get a second wireless transmitter?Guitar or bass: Should I use wireless?

{"prompt":"Is there a way to electronically modify the SM57 to reduce the amount of noise it outputs? All of my 57's hiss and have a \"hatching\" buzz in them (not 60 cycle).","completion":"The SM57 is a dynamic microphone, and thus does not have any active electronics in it. The SM57 is simply a voice coil and transformer. The noise output of dynamic microphones is essentially zero, the same as a resistor. This is much, much less than the noise from the input circuitry of a mixer. If you are having noise problems, you should check the cables and mixer."}

{"prompt":"I have an application where I need to send audio from one place to another. Both ends will be stationary, so I do not need battery powered or portable devices. Can you help?","completion":"Point to Point Wireless Audio SystemsIntroductionOften it is desirable (or even mandatory) to send an audio signal from one fixed location to another fixed location without wires. This is termed \"point-to-point\" wireless. In some cases this may involve a single transmit location and multiple receive locations, referred to as \"point-to-multi-point\" wireless. Possible applications include remote speaker/amplifier locations, remote recording/broadcast operations, and one-way communication links. Potentially this could be accomplished either by optical transmission or by radio frequency transmission.Optical methods are inherently limited to line-of-sight conditions. The use of conventional (non-directional) infrared transmission is limited by ambient light levels vs. practical infrared power levels. Modulated laser transmission (highly directional) is another optical possibility but available systems are primarily geared to high-speed data/video transmission and are not widely (or affordably) distributed.Low-power radio transmission systems, on the other hand, are both widely available and relatively affordable. For radio signals, line-of-sight conditions are desirable but they are not strictly required. In addition, point-to-multi-point is more easily accomplished with a single radio transmitter.General requirements for point-to-point wireless include:High fidelity audioLine level in and line level outAC-power capability for both transmitter and receiver\"Sufficient\" transmission distanceMost radio communication products such as wireless intercoms, two-way radios, and mobile phones are unsuitable due to lack of audio fidelity. However, two common high-fidelity radio products that can be used in a point-to-point application are the wireless microphone system and the wireless in-ear monitor system. Each of these has slightly different concerns/advantages in performance and in setup.Using Shure wireless microphones for point-to-pointA bodypack wireless system can fulfill the requirements above with two modifications. First, though many receivers have line level outputs, few transmitters are capable of accepting a line level input signal. This can be accomplished by using an external pad or attenuator at the transmitter input. Second, though most receivers run on AC power, transmitters are battery-only devices. Using a suitable external DC power supply can provide the necessary AC capability for the transmitter.Depending on the input signal, two off-the-shelf attenuator solutions exist for Shure bodypack transmitters equipped with TA4 input connectors. A balanced, +4dBu source can be accommodated by using a Shure A15LA (-50dB, XLR-to-XLR, in-line attenuator) in combination with a Shure WA310 (XLR-to-TA4F adapter cable).An unbalanced, -10dBV source can be accommodated by using an RCA to 1/4\" female phone jack cable in combination with a Shure WA302 (1/4” phone-to-TA4F adapter cable). Most Shure bodypacks operate on a pair of AA batteries (3vdc total). Shure bodypacks that use the SB900A battery, can also use the SBC-DC battery eliminator.Once the input signal is sufficiently attenuated and power is provided, the bodypack transmitter should be located to provide the best line-of-sight to the receiver. This usually involves securing the pack to a pole or some other elevated structure. If wet weather is a factor, the transmitter can be protected by a \"ziplock\" bag or other covering.At the receiver, no modification is usually required since it is AC powered and has a line level output.AntennasThe antennas supplied with all Shure wireless products are omnidirectional. These are suitable for both point-to-point and point-to-multi-point applications. If additional transmission range is required it may be possible to use directional receiving and/or transmitting antenna(s). Note that although diversity receivers are always preferred it may not be necessary (or practical) to use directional antennas on both antenna inputs for point-to-point. Since the transmitter and receiver locations are assumed to be fixed in this application, multipath variations should be minimal once the equipment is set up.The UA874 powered directional antenna can be used with the receiver directly.Maximum range of point-to-point wirelessThe practical range for most of these systems in point-to-point applications is comparable to their published range in normal usage. For standard wireless systems this ranges from about 150 ft. to 800 ft. depending on various conditions. Directional antennas may boost these ranges by 50%. Good line of sight and the normal precautions for frequency selection are assumed.If greater distances are required, it can be accomplished by using an additional system as \"repeater.\" That is, at the location of the first receiver a second transmitter is set up to rebroadcast the signal to a more distant second receiver. Of course, each of these additional systems has to be on a different compatible frequency. The practical limit for a repeater system using standard wireless equipment is about 3 \"hops\" due to increased noise and distortion.SummaryIt is possible to employ Shure wireless systems for point-to-point applications in several ways. Both wireless microphone systems and PSM systems can be used, each with different adaptations. The modifications are primarily for AC powering of battery powered devices and for matching audio signal levels. Special connectors and/or adapters may also be necessary in some cases.For moderate distance, single channel applications use wireless microphone systems for good results. Multi-channel, especially stereo, transmission may benefit from the PSM approach. Longer distance uses will require directional antennas for wireless microphone receivers or for PSM transmitters. Maximum range applications can be handled by the dual directional antenna PSM setup or by using multiple systems in a repeater configuration.SourcesWinegard(319) 754-0600"}
{"prompt":"When I place the Shure SB900 battery pack into the SBC800-US charger, there is a yellow LED that blinks. What does this mean?","completion":"The blinking yellow LED indicates that the SB900 battery has been placed in the charger incorrectly. The battery is positioned \"backwards.\" That is, the label is still facing up but the orientation has been reversed for the positive and negative ends.The SB900 battery can be inserted into the SBC800 tray charger or the SBC200 docking charger in reverse orientation. Although the SB900 will not snap into place with the usual reassuring \"thunk\", it will fit and will make contact with the at least some of the charging contacts. Depending on how firmly the SB900 is fitted into the charger, it will either display a blinking yellow LED immediately or it will display a red LED (charging) for 10-20 seconds after which time the red LED will go out and the blinking yellow LED will illuminate.The SBC200 charger can detect when the SBC900 battery is reversed in the transmitter. It is feasible to insert the SB900 battery, in reverse orientation, into the ULXD handheld transmitter or ULXD bodypack transmitter. If either transmitter is then placed into the SBC200, the corresponding red LED will illuminate for 10-20 seconds after which time the red LED will go out and a blinking yellow LED will illuminate. Note: the red and green LED's only appear to operate in a non-blinking mode. When the battery is in the \"0-90%\" condition, the red LED is solid. When the battery is in the \"90-99%\" condition, both the green and red LED's are solid. Finally, when the battery is in the \"99-100%\" condition, the green LED is solid and the red LED is dark.The blinking yellow light can also indicate a problem with an individual SB900 battery. The charger will display the same error when the affected battery is inserted in a different bay. A wireless transmitter also will display an error message when used with a malfunctioning battery."}

{"prompt":"I was looking at the user guide for the ULX-D for information about battery meters for different types of batteries however it doesn't list the meter for using NiMH batteries. Can you direct me to a chart for using them?

Unlike Alkaline batteries which is a one-shot use and are loser in tolerance when using name brands, there are hundreds of types of NiMH batteries and they tend to not be consistent.Different NiMH cells were tested and an average was compiled to use for the metering. Here's what was found in testing:1 or 10 mW settings:FULL Bars = 11.2 to 14 hours (battery at approx.100%)4 bars = 7 to 11.2 hours3 bars = 2.8 to 7 hours2 bars = 1.4 to 2.8 hours1 bar = 20 min to 1.4 hoursWarning bar comes between 20 minutes and 0 minutes remaining (approx. 5% of battery life)20 mW setting:FULL bars = 7.6 to 9 hours4 bars = 5.25 to 7.6 hours3 bars =- 2.1 to 5.25 hours2 bars = 1 to 2.1 hours1 bar = 15 min to 1 hourWarning bar comes on between 15 minutes and 0 minutes remaining (approx. 5%of battery life)There is a wide range time-wise right in the middle of the battery life range likely due to the wide variation of the different batteries tested. Because an average was used, it is also not possible to really correlate a specific voltage.If NiMH cells are already owned must be employed, these test values may be useful. However, we recommend using the Shure SB-900 Lithium ION batteries. These are more consistent, do not suffer from memory-effect, have a very long life cycle (at least 500 cycles to 80% health), offer about the same or higher life per charge, and offer more accurate battery life metering that is displayed in Hours and Minutes instead of bars. The initial investment in these batteries and chargers is substantial, but the performance and life of the batteries should make up for the cost over the life of the system."}
{"prompt":"I'm looking for a mic that fits inside a Clasical guitar that will pick up the Nylon strings nicely for recording. Do you have any products of that sort under $200?","completion":"Before you make any buying decision, please read the following:MICROPHONE TECHNIQUE FOR THE CLASSICAL GUITARby Michael PettersenDirector of Applications Engineering - Shure Inc.Miking a classical guitar for recording or amplification is a mystery to most players. This article briefly explains microphone selection and placement as both influence the sound of your recorded or amplified guitar.A guitar radiates a different timbre in every direction and each guitar surface produces a distinct timbre. By adjusting the mic position relative to the guitar, tonal balance can be dramatically altered. A guitar is designed to sound best at a distance, i.e. two or more feet away. It is \"at a distance\" that the numerous sounds radiating from the guitar surfaces combine into a pleasing composite. A microphone placed \"at a distance\" tends to pick up a well-balanced tone quality. In contrast, a mic placed very close to the guitar tends to emphasize the surface that the microphone is near. Therefore, the sound from a closely placed mic will not be representative of the guitar as a whole. Keeping this in mind, here are fundamentals to observe when miking a guitar:Use a condenser unidirectional microphone with a flat (neutral) frequency response. Suggested Shure models are the KSM137, KSM44, KSM32, SM27, SM81.A unidirectional mic boosts the bass progressively as it is placed closer to the guitar. This is proximity effect. When miking less than one foot away, be aware of this effect. Recording-quality mics, like the Shure SM81, often have a switch to reduce the bass.For initial mic positioning, close one ear with a finger while someone plays your guitar. Listen with your other ear. Move around until you find a spot that sounds good. Put the mic there. Placing the microphone close will reduce the pick up of room acoustics and background noise. This can be important if recording in a less than ideal lo-cation. But miking too close will color the guitar's timbre.My favorite miking position for recording is: Place the mic next to your right ear. Aim the mic downward toward the guitar bridge. With my guitar, this position sounds very natural and well-balanced.When amplifying your guitar, you may encounter feedback. In these cases, position the mic very close to the loudest part of the guitar. Then experiment with mic choice, speaker location, and equalization to obtain your desired tonal balance and sound level.Remember that a difference of only one inch can make a tremendous difference in what the mic picks up. There is no one perfect way to mike a guitar as there is no single ideal mic to use. Like playing, it is part science and part art. Choose and place the mic to get the sound you want. Experiment and listen!If after reading this article, you still want to place a mic inside of the guitar, we suggest you audition the Shure SM93 and the Shure MX183."}

{"prompt":"What are some tips, techniques, and mic selections for barbershop quartets?","completion":"The following is an excerpt from an article by the Barbershop Harmony Society.  SPEBSQSA Microphone and Sound System Guidelines, Written by Glen Glancy and Bill Lightner, Edited by Doug Maddox, October 22,1999. This document establishes a common source of microphone and sound system guidelines for the members of the Society. We recommend small diaphragm cardioid condenser microphones, which are suitable for use with both quartets and choruses. We do not recommend large diaphragm condenser microphones – the choice for vocal recording – for SPEBSQSA events. When floor monitor speakers are used at the singing position, the typical loss of pattern control at low frequencies in these microphones results in feedback. In simple terminology, the monitors cannot be loud enough to be of benefit to the performers before the sound from the monitors is picked up by the microphones and re-amplified, causing what is known as feedback. Small diaphragm microphones provide better low frequency pattern control and therefore can be used successfully with floor monitor speakers.Quartet Microphone SetupA pair of the same microphones should be mounted to a single mic stand using a device called a “stereo bar.” A stereo bar is a simple flat bar that attaches at the center of a standard mic stand and has a slug at each end for attaching a standard mic clip to the bar. Microphones attached in such a manner can then be aimed by adjusting the clips to point the capsules in relationship to the performers.Choosing a Mic StandIf the stage is a permanent one, we recommend an Atlas Soundolier MS25 stand with a boom attachment. This is a heavy-duty stand with a tripod-shaped heavyweight cast iron base. It is capable of supporting the microphones on a boom without additional weights to hold the stand in place. The boom attachment places the vertical portion of the stand out of the way of hand gestures by the performers. Straw hats, canes, and other props have a knack for finding their way against a mic stand. If the stage is a temporary one, we recommend an Atlas Soundolier BS36 stand placed on the solid floor in front of the stage, weighted if necessary, and extended to place the microphones on a boom at stage height. You have seen this method used for the past several years at Internationals. It keeps the stage noises caused by performer movement from being picked up mechanically through the stand.Aligning the MicrophonesThe microphones should be at mid-chest height for a \"standard\" six-foot barbershop singer or higher. The microphones should be adjusted so the capsules are at the same point in space, perfectly aligned vertically with one atop the other, and as close as possible without the microphone bodies touching each other. Since you can actually see the capsules on most of the microphones we recommend, this should be easily accomplished before placing the windscreens on the mics. When viewed from the top, looking down at the mics, the capsules should create a pickup radius of about 180 degrees horizontally. So, if you begin with the capsules 90 degrees to each other and increase that angle by moving the capsules another 15 degrees each, you should be close to correct. The capsules should appear to crossfire and aim at quartet singing positions one and four. Only mic tests, which are described later, will confirm the accuracy of the alignment.Marking the Toe-Line RadiusThe next essential step – critical in competition but proper for shows as well – is to mark a standard radius on the floor that the performers are not allowed to cross. This \"toe-line\" radius should be approximately 36 inches from the center point of the microphone setup. Mark the floor with white tape or some other highly visible method that the performers will be able to see even with stage lights in their eyes.Placing the Floor Monitor SpeakersFloor monitor speakers should be placed behind the microphones, between the lip of the stage and the rear of the microphone arrangement. Place the speakers as close to the vertical mic stand as possible, angled out to face the performers. One speaker should serve performers one and two, and the other should serve performers three and four. The speakers should project sound toward the least sensitive area of the microphone pattern. With cardioid microphones, the least sensitive area is the backside of the capsule; therefore, you would aim the speakers at the tail of those microphones. Slight adjustments may be necessary to find the best sound gain before feedback, but generally this location will serve the needs of the performers. Adjustment of monitor EQ will be necessary to maximize available gain before feedback.Testing the MicrophonesThe off-axis pattern variations of the microphones are sufficiently different to require the following steps, although the setup may appear to match the preceding instructions. Perform the following steps to test the microphones:A single person, a talker, should alternately stand at quartet singing positions one and four, speaking directly on axis to each of the microphones, while the sound system operator adjusts the signal levels to match when heard in the house speakers. An appointed listener should be in the house to confirm this matching process.The talker should stand exactly between the microphones and, while speaking, move his head within a one-foot side-to-side distance to assure that no coloration of the sound occurs between the pickup of the two microphones. This sound variation is caused by “phasing,” which is a time domain problem between the two capsules. To fix a phasing problem, move one microphone along its own axis, in towards the other microphone or out away from the other microphone, until no “seam” in the coverage area can be discerned. It is important to retain the angle of the capsules to each other and move only the relationship of the capsules in the horizontal plane. The mechanical center between two microphones and the acoustical center between them may not be the same due to the physical makeup and construction of the particular microphone model. This is a result of construction techniques employed to tune the pickup pattern to the manufacturer1s design criteria.Confirm that this pair of microphones picks up all four voices with equal level. The talker should speak into the mics while moving around the toe line through the four singing positions. The listener should perceive no apparent level difference for those four positions. To verify the mic levelsIf the two outside singers appear to be louder than the two center singers, reduce the angle of the mics from the 110-120 degree setup to a setup closer to 90 degrees.If the center singers are too loud, increase the angle of the mics beyond the 120- degree point.This is a subtle adjustment. A couple of degrees will make a difference. Be sure to re-check the center pickup point if you have to make this change. Proper setup and testing will result in a microphone arrangement that will provide an accurate and sonically awesome representation of the quartet's barbershop sound that will both interface with a mono sound reinforcement system and also provide an excellent stereo pickup for recording.A superb document!

{"prompt":"Why do I hear an delay when I am using my Shure wireless system on my guitar? It does not happen onstage. It only happens when I go out into the audience to play. It gets worse as I get farther from the stage.","completion":"It is not the wireless guitar system. It is the laws of physics causing the delay.The signal from the wireless transmitter travels to the wireless receiver at nearly the speed of light: 186,282 miles per second or 1,084,161,240 feet per second. The average human perceives delay in an audio signal when the original sound is delayed by 0.05 second or more. For there to be a perceiveable audio delay from the wireless transmission, you would have to be 9,314 miles from the stage. Highly unlikely.But sound travels much slower than light. The speed of sound is about 1,100 feet per second. In 0.05 second, a sound wave travels about 55 feet. So if you are 55 feet from the main PA loudspeakers, you may perceive a delay. A guitarist may be even more sensitive to acoustic delay because he can perceive the difference between when a string was picked and when the sound was heard.Here is another way to look at this situation. An audience member that is 55 feet from the stage will hear your guitar delayed by 0.05 second because that is the time that the sound wave takes to travel from the stage to the audience member's ear. Place yourself next to that audience member and you will hear your guitar delayed by 0.05 second...even if you use a 55 foot long cable in place of the Shure wireless system."}
{"prompt":"How do theater professionals use and hide wireless bodypack transmitters?","completion":"Most bodypacks come with an attached belt clip. The obvious way to wear a bodypack transmitter is to clip the bodypack onto an actor’s clothing at the beltline or on the hip area. The transmitter can also fit into pockets of shirts, jackets, or pants with little hassle. Even so, it is important to allow the antenna to be unobstructed and fully extended.Extra pockets of fabric can be sewn into costuming when the bodypack needs to be as unobtrusive as possible without using the clip.The small of the back can be used for placement if a fanny pack or similar harness is used instead of the clip. Make sure the antenna is able to extend.A bodypack can be held between the shoulder blades and under costuming using a shoulder harness or \"back pack\" made up of a pouch for the pack and a couple of loops to go around the shoulders.Maintaining stability in some odd locations can require the use of cloth, elastic, or Velcro straps or bands. They should be stable enough to hold bodypacks on to arms and thighs.Affixing a large safety pin to a bodypack with gaffers tape can allow smaller, lighter bodypacks to be affixed to hats or wigs, although this may not be the best choice for physically active performances or dancing.RF signal can be blocked and reflected by metallic surfaces. This can include any costuming that has metal threading or metal plating, the extreme cases being your knight in shining armor. Wearing a bodypack under this material will severely degrade RF performance.Antennas of bodypacks should always be kept as clear as possible from obstructive surfaces or materials. As stated earlier, antennas should never be curled up, stuffed into pockets, or wrapped around the transmitter.Allow for strain relief on the microphone connector and antenna, so that movement of the actor will not crimp the cable or antenna with their movements. Repetitive strain on the cable will cause failure sooner rather than later. Remember to check cables and antennas thoroughly before each performance.You can utilize the lock out features of some bodypacks to make sure the actor cannot accidentally power off the transmitter during a performance, or in the case of frequency agile systems, accidentally change the operating frequency.Make sure to leave the battery as accessible as possible, as you may need to do a quick change unexpectedly.The human body, because of its composition, can cause some RF transmission issues with bodypack transmitters. In certain cases, the body of the actor can potentially inhibit RF transmission. Repositioning the bodypack or the receiving antennas (or both) can overcome this occurrence.Sweat can be potentially harmful to the electronics of a bodypack transmitter. There are many methods sound designers have created to protect bodypacks from sweat. A simple solution is to wear a Neoprene transmitter pouch when feasible. While not completely waterproof, it will protect the bodypack from sweat and low level moisture. Another more protective method is to use a dry condom to cover the bodypack. As unusual as it sounds, it is fairly effective when used properly. An un-powdered, dry surgical glove can also be used. Remember that there are people allergic to latex or other materials, so check with the talent ahead of time before using any method of covering a bodypack next to skin.It is a good idea to clearly label your bodypacks in some manner to identify the intended user. Any mix-ups can destroy the continuity of the show and cause the sound engineer to search for the right mixer channel to operate during the show.Do not leave transmitters bunched together on a table or in a bin while they are turned on. The proximity of the transmitters to each other can increase the likelihood of intermodulation distortion (IMD) manifesting itself on one or more receivers. The same effects can occur when poorly chosen frequencies are used on bodypacks that are very close to each other on stage. Proper selection of frequencies is a must.Bodypacks can come equipped with a variety of input connectors, depending on the manufacturer. Most will supply bias voltage for condenser elements. Using one manufacturer’s wireless lavalier microphone with another manufacturer’s transmitter and receiver is not out of the question. It is a matter of contacting the manufacturer of either and getting the proper \"pin outs\" of the connector types. It may require purchasing a mic with no connector, or rewiring the proper connector on to the lavalier in the right manner. Do not assume the mic will work because that if the connector is the same between manufacturers. There are several ways of wiring any given connector.When using bodypack transmitters simultaneously with wireless in-ear monitor receivers, make sure the packs are separated as much as possible to avoid any RF interaction between the two. The methods used for concealing bodypack transmitters can also be used for wireless in-ear monitor receivers, as they are the same general shape and size."}

{"prompt":"Will my MX391 microphone work without the supplied external preamplifier? What is its function? I would like to solder an XLR directly onto the cable from the mic and connect it to a mixer with phantom power.","completion":"A condenser microphone preamp is part of the complete microphone design, not an optional accessory. The only reason a condenser mic model is available without the preamp is for use with a wireless transmitter. In that case, the microphone element is powered from bias voltage provided by the transmitter.  Phantom power applied directly to the microphone element will damage it.The preamp takes the signal from the mic element, which is medium impedance and unbalanced, and converts it to a low impedance, balanced signal - suitable for connection to standard professional XLR microphone inputs with phantom power.  The preamp also converts phantom power to bias power to operate the mic element.All condenser microphones have a preamp; this includes headworn condenser mics and lavalier condenser mics.  With handheld condenser microphones and studio condenser microphones the preamp is not as obvious, because the preamp circuity is contained within the mic handle/housing.\"Preamp\" is perhaps not the best term to use, as rarely is signal amplification a function of this type of device.  A better term would be \"Impedance convertor, unbalanced-to-balanced convertor, and phantom power-to-bias convertor,\" but preamp is simpler."}

{"prompt":"I want to mic my school play but I'm having problems with feedback. I've seen other theaters get good sound. How do I do it?","completion":"Theater Sound: The Science Behind the IllusionHave you ever noticed how great Broadway shows sound? Does the rock band in \"Rent\" get your blood pumping? Do the lyrics to \"Memories\" get you choked up every time? Are you ready to run to the local music store and spend a few hundred dollars on some overhead microphones so your local theater (or grade school, high school, church production, etc.) can get that incredible clarity and power? Well, hang on just a minute. Before you run out to spend those hard-earned tax dollars, let’s take a quick look at the realities of theater sound, and what you can realistically expect from your venue.Microphones for everybody!Most theaters that operate on a limited budget try to use as few microphones as possible. Common techniques include hanging a few microphones overhead, and maybe a few boundary (or surface mount) microphones at the front of the stage. There are many inherent problems with these techniques, including, but not limited to:Reduced gain before feedback due to too many open microphones too far away from the actors.Comb filtering (that thin, hollow sound) resulting from multiple microphones picking up the same actor.Increased pickup of stage vibration noise, reverberation, and other unwanted sounds.Varying sound levels as actors move in and out of the pick-up areas of different microphones.How do professional theaters deal with these issues? Easy - they don’t. Every performer on stage gets a wireless microphone. Most Broadway productions use over a hundred thousand dollars worth of wireless microphones for a single show. A basic rule of microphone technique for any application is get the microphone as close as possible to the desired sound source. Therefore, even though you can’t always see it, each actor has a small lavalier microphone clipped, taped, glued, or sewn to some part of the face, hair, or costume. Having every actor “close-miked” eliminates all of the above problems encountered with distant miking. The distance between the microphone and the actor’s mouth remains constant, thus providing a constant output level. High sound level shows such as “Rent” go a step further, using headset microphones to get the microphone even closer to the sound source.The Overhead DilemmaOkay, so your budget doesn’t quite get up to Broadway standards. Using a few overhead microphones for smaller speaking parts can be an acceptable alternative, but be realistic about what to expect. Consider the following example: Two actors on stage, one is wearing a lavalier microphone six inches from his mouth, the other is standing six feet from the nearest overhead microphone. The actor wearing the lavalier will be 21 dB louder than the other actor will. Realistically, a 21dB difference will sound four times as loud!Turning the microphones up louder is not always an option, either. For any given sound system, the farther the microphones are from the sound source, and the closer they are to the loudspeakers, the less you can turn them up before feedback occurs. Multiple open microphones will further increase the chances for feedback. In addition, distant microphones will pick up more ambient sound, making the actors sound farther away, when compared to close-miked actors. If you choose to use overhead microphones, pay close attention to where the actors are standing when they speak. If the actors are always as close to the microphones as possible, sound quality will improve. Turning down unused microphones will also help.For downstage areas, or runways where it is not practical to hang an overhead microphone, boundary microphones are often used. These small, flat microphones are usually placed at the edge of stage, where they will be out of the actors way. Boundary microphones are not magic; they are subject to the same limitations as overhead microphones, with the additional issue of stage vibration pick-up.Overhead and boundary microphones that you may see in a Broadway production are not necessarily used for sound reinforcement, either. Many times they are used for hearing assist, backstage cues, or recording.One final note on microphones: shotgun microphones are never used for sound reinforcement! The shotgun microphone was designed for film and video production work, where the microphone signals are going straight to tape. It does not \"focus\" on the sound coming from the stage, nor does it filter out unwanted sounds. A shotgun placed at the back of the hall will pick up everything that happens between the microphone and the stage.AcousticsAnother issue that can plague amateur theater is poor acoustics. The typical “cafe-gymna-torium” that is used for many school and church theatrical productions is, acoustically speaking, the worst possible place for sound reinforcement. These rooms tend to be extremely \"echo-y\", which limits intelligibility (the ability to understand what is being said) and decreases gain before feedback (how loud you can turn up the sound system).Professional productions are done in quiet, non-reflective, controlled environments that are optimized for theater sound. Many theaters also employ a distributed sound system, which uses many speakers placed throughout the venue that are divided into “zones”. Each zone is fed a varying amount of signal, depending on how far they are from the stage. Loudspeakers nearest the stage get very little, if any, signal, while those at the back get proportionally more. This also allows the overall volume level to be lower, which improves intelligibility in a poor acoustic environment.Know your performers!Lastly, remember to keep in mind the skill level of the performers involved. Professional actors and singers know how to project their voice, which creates more signal level at the microphone. Children, especially shy ones, do not make much sound, which further necessitates close-miking techniques. As mentioned above, turning distant microphones up louder will most likely result in feedback. Remember, if you can’t hear what the actors are saying from six feet away, the microphone certainly can’t either!If the above examples seem to paint a grim picture, don’t despair. Placing the microphones as close as possible to the actors mouths will always result in improved sound quality. Just be aware that overhead microphones, used carefully, can increase intelligibility for smaller speaking roles. What they cannot do, however, is create a Broadway-like experience. Wireless microphones and carefully controlled, expensive sound systems operated by top-flight sound technicians are the science behind the illusion in professional theater."}

{"prompt":"What is intermodulation?","completion":"This is a excerpt from Selection and Operation of Wireless Microphones.Frequency SelectionSelecting the operating frequency of a wireless audio system is a two-step process: first, choose an appropriate radio frequency band; second, choose the appropriate operating frequency (or frequencies) within that band. There is a finite number of wireless microphone systems that may be used simultaneously in any one frequency range. The reasons for this limitation are several and they fall under the general topic of frequency coordination or \"compatibility.\" We will define these factors and examine each in terms of origin, effects, and relative importance to total system compatibility. In the first section we will consider only interactions that may occur between the individual wireless microphone systems themselves.At this point it should be stated that frequency coordination is a process that must take into account various factors including the physical (limitations), the mathematical (calculations) and the political (regulations). It is not necessary for most users to go through the details of this process. Wireless manufacturers provide this service through pre-selected frequency groups and can also offer assistance in complex applications using proprietary computer programs. What follows here is an introduction to the process for the interested user.System CompatibilityThe two main areas of concern are: interaction between transmitters and receivers related to their operating frequencies, and interactions between transmitters and receivers related to their internal frequencies. The first class of interactions is the more important one and may occur in any group of wireless microphone systems. It is also the one more cumbersome to calculate. The second class of interactions is less problematic and is also relatively easy to predict. However, it is determined by specific system characteristics.Operating Frequency Interactions: IntermodulationA single wireless microphone system can theoretically be used on any open operating frequency. When a second system is added it must be on a different operating frequency in order to be used at the same time as the first. This limitation arises from the nature of radio receivers: they cannot properly demodulate more than one signal on the same frequency. In other words, it is not possible for a receiver to \"mix\" the signals from multiple transmitters. If one signal is substantially stronger than the others it will \"capture\" the receiver and block out the other signals. If the signals are of comparable strength none of them will be received clearly.The effect of this is often heard in automobile radios when travelling out of range of one station and into the range of another station at the same frequency. The receiver will switch back and forth between the two stations as their relative signal strength changes, often with considerable noise and distortion. The result is that neither station is listenable when the signals are nearly equal.If the wireless microphone systems must be on different frequencies, how \"different\" should they be? The limiting characteristic of the receiver in this regard is its \"selectivity\" or its ability to differentiate between adjacent frequencies. The greater the selectivity the closer together the operating frequencies can be. The recommended minimum frequency difference ranges from 300kHz to 1.5 MHz, depending on receiver selectivity.When a third system is added to the group it must be at least the recommended frequency difference from each of the existing systems. However, it is now necessary to consider other potential interactions between the transmitters to insure that all three systems will be compatible with each other. The most important type of interaction is called intermodulation (IM), and it arises when signals are applied to \"non-linear\" circuits. (See Figure 3-4.)  A characteristic of a non-linear circuit is that its output contains \"new\" signals in addition to the original signals that were applied to the circuit. These additional signals are called IM products and are produced within the circuit components themselves. The frequencies of IM products are mathematically related to the original transmitter frequencies. Specifically, they consist of sums and differences of the original frequencies, multiples of the original frequencies, and sums and differences of the multiples. Non-linear circuits are intrinsic to the design of wireless components and include the output stages of transmitters and the input stages of receivers. The \"mixer\" stage at the receiver input is an example of a non-linear circuit: recall that it is designed to produce a \"difference\" frequency that becomes the intermediate frequency (IF) for subsequent stages.IM can occur when transmitters are in close proximity to each other. The signal from each transmitter generates IM products in the output stage of the other. These new signals are transmitted along with the original signals and can be picked up by receivers operating at the corresponding IM frequencies. (See Figure 3-7.)  IM can also occur when transmitters are operated very close to receivers. In this case IM products are generated in the receiver input stage which can interfere with the desired signal or be detected by the receiver if the desired signal (transmitter) is not present.The strongest IM products are the two so-called 3rd order products produced by two adjacent transmitters operating at frequency f1 and frequency f2, where f1 is lower than f2. The resulting IM products may be calculated as:          IM1 = (2 x f1) – f2          IM2 = (2 x f2) – f1If the interval between f1 and f2 is F, then IM1 = f1 – F and IM2 = f2 + F. That is, one IM will appear exactly at interval F above the upper frequency f2 while the other IM will appear exactly at interval F below the lower frequency. For example, if f1 = 180MHz and f2 = 190MHz, then F = 10MHz. Thus, IM1 = 170MHz and IM2 = 200MHz. (See Figure 3-5.)    In addition to IM products generated by interaction between two transmitters, other IM products are generated by interaction between three transmitters in a similar fashion. (See Figure 3-6.) In order to avoid potential IM problems most manufacturers recommend a minimum margin of 250 kHz (0.25 MHz) between any 3rd order IM product and any operating frequency. This further restricts available frequency choices as the number of simultaneous systems increases.    It should be apparent from this discussion that the prediction of potential compatibility problems due to IM products is best left to computer programs. The complexity increases exponentially for additional systems: a group of 10 wireless microphone systems involves thousands of calculations.Internal frequency Interactions: LO, IF, Crystal MultipliersIn addition to frequency conflicts due to intermodulation between operating frequencies there are certain other sources of potential conflicts due to the various \"internal\" frequencies present in the normal operation of transmitters and receivers. These differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from system to system from the same manufacturer.One such source is the local oscillator (LO) of the receiver itself. Although this is a low-level signal which is generally confined within the receiver, it is possible for the local oscillator of one receiver to be picked up by another receiver tuned to that LO frequency if they or their antennas are in close proximity to each other (stacked, for instance). For example, assuming a typical intermediate frequency (IF) of 10.7 MHz, a receiver tuned to 200.7 MHz would have its LO operating at 190.0 MHz. Another receiver tuned to 190 MHz should not be used close to the first receiver because the second unit could pick up the LO of the first, especially if the 190 MHz transmitter is turned off or is operating at a great distance. (See Figure 3-8.) Good design and shielding in receivers and physical separation of receivers will minimize the possibility of LO interference. For multiple units, active antenna splitters will effectively isolate antenna inputs from each other. However, it is still recommended that operating frequencies be chosen to avoid LO frequencies by at least 250 KHz.    An \"image\" frequency is another source of possible interference. In a receiver, recall that the frequency of the local oscillator (LO) always differs from the frequency of the received signal by an amount equal to the intermediate frequency (IF). Specifically, the operating frequency is above the local oscillator frequency by an interval equal to the IF. When these two frequencies are applied to the mixer section (a non-linear circuit) one of the output frequencies of the mixer is this difference frequency (the IF), which is the tuned frequency of the subsequent IF stage filters.If the frequency of a second signal is at the same interval below the local oscillator frequency, the difference between this second frequency and the LO frequency would again be equal to the intermediate frequency (IF). The mixer stage does not discriminate between \"positive\" or \"negative\" frequency differences. If this second (lower) frequency enters the mixer stage, it will result in another (difference) signal getting to the IF stages and causing possible interference. This lower frequency is called the \"image\" of the originalfrequency. Again, assuming an IF of 10.7 MHz, a receiver tuned to 200.7 MHz would have its LO at 190.0 MHz. A signal from another transmitter at 179.3 MHz would appear as an image frequency since it is 10.7 MHz below the LO frequency or 21.4 MHz below the operating frequency.The image frequency differs from the operating frequency by an amount equal to two times the intermediate frequency (2 x IF). (See Figures 3-9 a & b.) The image frequency will be below the operating frequency for a high-side injection receiver and above the operating frequency for a low-side injection receiver. Thus the image frequency for the typical single conversion receiver is at least 20 MHz away from the operating frequency. Double conversion receivers, which have a relatively high first IF (50 MHz typical), have image frequencies which are even farther (>100 MHz typical) away from the operating frequency. In most cases, the front end of the receiver should be able to reject an image frequency unless it is extremely strong. Nevertheless, it is recommended that operating frequencies be chosen to be at least 250 KHz from any image frequency.      The last internal frequency issue concerns the VCO in crystal controlled transmitters. Recall that the actual VCO frequency is a relatively low radio frequency that is multiplied to obtain the final transmitter frequency. A small amount of the original crystal frequency remains after each multiplier stage. Thus the output signal includes not only the final operating frequency but also low-level \"spurs\" or spurious emissions due to the multipliers. These spurs occur above and below the operating frequency at intervals equal to \"harmonics\" (multiples) of the original crystal frequency.For example, assuming a 9 x multiplier, a 180 MHz transmitter would have a 20 MHz crystal frequency. This would produce spurs at 160 MHz and 200 MHz, 140 MHz and 220 MHz, etc. Good transmitter design will minimize the amplitude of such crystal harmonics but, again, additional receivers should be chosen to avoid these frequencies by at least 250 KHz. (See Figure 3-10.)    Frequency-synthesized transmitters do not produce spurious emissions of this type because they do not employ multipliers. However, both types of transmitters can produce other spurious emissions due to power regulating circuitry, parasitic oscillations, carrier harmonics, etc. These emissions can all be controlled through careful design.It can be seen that the calculation of both local oscillator conflicts and image frequencies depends on the intermediate frequency (IF) of the receiver while calculation of crystal harmonics depends on the number of multipliers in the transmitter. If receivers with different IFs or transmitters with different multipliers are being used together (i.e. units from different manufacturers) this must be taken into account in compatibility analysis. Unfortunately, only a few proprietary computer programs for frequency selection have this capability. Input to most of these programs assumes that all units are of the same design. For this reason, accurate prediction of compatibility between systems of different design is not always possible."}

{"prompt":"I've heard the term \"dB\" used frequently in sound. What is it? How do I calculate it?","completion":"THE DECIBELWhat is a dB?The decibel (dB) is an expression often used in electrical and acoustic measurements. The decibel is a number that represents a ratio of two values of a quantity such as voltage. It is actually a logarithmic ratio whose main purpose is to scale a large measurement range down to a much smaller and more useable range. The decibel is not a unit of measure such as feet, inches, or pounds. The decibel is a comparison between two values. The form of the decibel relationship for voltage is:dB = 20 x log(V1/V2)where 20 is a constant, V1 is one voltage, V2 is the other voltage, and log is logarithm base 10.Examples:  What is the relationship in decibels between 100 volts and 1 volt?dB = 20 x log(100/1)dB = 20 x log(100)dB = 20 x 2 (the log of 100 is 2)dB = 40That is, 100 volts is 40dB greater than 1 volt.What is the relationship in decibels between 0.001 volt and 1 volt?dB = 20 x log(0.001/1)dB = 20 x log(0.001)dB = 20 x (-3) (the log of .001 is -3)dB = -6That is, 0.001 volt is 60dB less that 1 volt.Similarly:if one voltage is equal to the other they are 0dB differentif one voltage is twice the other they are 6dB differentif one voltage is ten times the other they are 20dB differentWhat is dBV or dBm?Since the decibel is a ratio of two values, there must be an explicit or implicit reference value for any measurement given in dB. This is usually indicated by a suffix on the decibel value such as: dBV (reference to 1 volt which is 0dBV) or dBm (reference to 0.775 volts). In other words, to calculate dBV, use \"1 volt\" as V2 in the above equations. To calculate dBm, use \"0.774 volts\" as V2 in the above equations. Therefore, dBV and dBm are a little different than just a plain \"dB\" because they have a specific set value for V2. The terms \"dBV\" and \"dBm\" are units of measure, where as the term \"dB\" is not a unit of measure.What is dB SPLJust like dBV or dBm, dB SPL uses a constant, specific value in the denominator of the equation. dB SPL is referenced to 0.0002 microbar. In other words, 0.0002 microbar is equal to 0 dB SPL. Therefore, if a sound level measures 75 dB SPL, that means the sound is 74 dB greater than 0.0002 microbar. The term \"dB SPL\" is a unit of measure, where as the term \"dB\" is not a unit of measure.Be very careful about the use of the term \"dB\". The term \"dB\" should only be used when talking about greater than, less than, increased by, or decreased by. At all other times, the terms \"dBV\", \"dBm\", \"dB SPL\", \"dBW\", \"dBs\", etc should be used.  Incorrect: \"This microphone has an output level of -54 dB.\"Correct: \"This microphone has an output level of -54 dBV.\"Incorrect: \"The sound pressure level was 102 dB.\"Correct: \"The sound pressure level was 102 dB SPL.\"Correct: \"The first track is 2 dB louder than the second track.\" (This statement is correct because it is specifically stating that the first and second track are being compared. Thus, both values that are being compared are given.)Correct: \"John is 1.5 dB taller than Bill.\" (While the decibel is typically used for audio and electrical comparisons, it can be used for other comparisons, such as length, weight, etc.)One reason that the decibel is so useful in certain audio measurements is that this scaling function closely approximates the behavior of human hearing sensitivity. For example, a change of 1dB SPL is about the smallest difference in loudness that can be perceived while a 3dB SPL change is generally noticeable. A 6dB SPL change is quite noticeable and finally, a 10dB SPL change is perceived as \"twice as loud.\""}

{"prompt":"How far away does the MXA910 Ceiling Array pick-up? How high can I mount it?","completion":"Higher and farther than a single element microphone! However, room acoustics still matter. Noisier and more reverberant environments will impact speech intelligibility at greater distances from the microphone. Because of its three-dimensional steering capability and extremely narrow pick up pattern, the MXA910 can pick up talkers at greater distances than any other microphone.A useful concept in understanding how far away a microphone may be placed is \"distance factor.\" Distance factor is based on the use of an omnidirectional microphone placed a distance X from a sound source while providing an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.  Now, at what distance a directional microphone be placed and achieve the same results? For a cardioid microphone, the distance factor is 1.7 times the distance used for the omnidirectional microphone. The MXA910 distance factor is an amazing 4.3. In a room where an omnidirectional microphone is used successfully at a distance of 2 feet from the talker, the MXA910 would deliver similar results at a distance of 8.6 feet.  By way of comparison, a highly directional shotgun microphone has a distance factor of only 3. This is what we mean by \"higher and farther than a single element microphone.\"The following guidelines must be kept in mind when deciding where to place the MXA910:Like all microphones, best practice is to aim lobes towards the front of each talker. Mic lobes aimed at the back of the head lose high frequency response. Carefully consider placement in rooms where talkers may face a screen during a video conference.Avoid installing the microphone directly next to unwanted sound sources, such as air vents or noisy projectors.Consider installing acoustic treatment to improve speech intelligibility in rooms that are too reverberant."}

{"prompt":"What are the operational details of Shure's Automatic Gain Control design in the DFR22, P4800 or DP11EQ?","completion":"What is the AGC and how is it used?The Automatic Gain Control (AGC) works like a sound engineer with a finger on the input fader. It adjusts the gain of a channel based on how loud or soft the input signal is. If the input is loud, the gain is turned down. If the input is soft, the gain is turned up.The primary application of the AGC is in spoken word applications. Example: Several different talkers speak into a single microphone on a lectern. Some talkers are soft or talk far away from the microphone, and some talkers are loud or speak close to the microphone. When a soft-spoken person begins to speak, the gain gradually turns up until it is at the pre-set optimal level. The gain stays at this level until another talker addresses the microphone. When a loud talker speaks, the gain gradually gets turned down until it is at the pre-set optimal level.Another application is when a lapel microphone is being used. One talker places the lapel microphone close to his mouth and in the center of the chest. Another speaker places her microphone in a less optimal position. The AGC will respond to these situations by turning the gain down or up, respectively.If any talker quickly changes her volume by shouting, whispering, or getting very close to the microphone, that 'peak' or 'valley' will pass through the AGC. The AGC will not quickly adjust the gain like a compressor. But if a given talker changes her speech level style for several seconds (based on the attack /decay time), then the AGC will respond with a gain change.What do the AGC attack and decay times mean?The attack and decay settings determine how fast the AGC responds to a changing input level. Longer attack / decay times will cause the gain to change more slowly and shorter attack / decay times will result in faster changing gain.To determine which to use (attack or decay), the AGC looks at the input level’s direction in relationship to the hinge threshold. The attack time is used when the input level is moving away from the hinge point, and the decay time is used when the input level is moving towards the hinge point.Note that the AGC is not meant to have a short attack time. A long attack time of 1-2 seconds or more is appropriate. The decay time should also be several seconds. If attack times are too short, the AGC responds too quickly and the benefit of the speech detector is lost.How does the Speech Detector work in the AGC? Can the AGC be used with non-speech signals?The speech detector in the AGC is more accurately called an \"activity in the speech frequency band\" detector. It detects activity that occurs in the speech range above the level of the ambient room noise. The detector adapts to ambient noise and triggers when it detects some activity above that ambient noise floor.When the speech detector detects the presence of activity in the fundamental speech frequency band, the AGC operates as normal. When the speech detector signals that no activity is detected, the last gain applied is held until the speech detector sees more activity. In this way, the speech detector prevents the ‘pumping’ of the noise floor while a talker pauses.Though designed for speech, the AGC with speech detector also works effectively on non-speech signals such as musical instruments or singing. For example, the AGC could turn up a guitar after the player starts finger picking and turn it back down after the player starts strumming.What’s the difference between the AGC in the DP11EQ (discontinued), P4800 (discontinued), and DFR22?Each product has a slightly different implementation of the AGC. The original algorithm was developed for the DP11EQ. The implementation in the DFR22 is nearly identical; the only difference is that the DFR22’s AGC has an improved weighting filter in the speech detector. The DP11EQ’s filter causes the speech detector to trigger on the higher portion of the speech band. This band includes mostly fricatives, like \"s\", \"f\", \"sh\", \"k\", etc. The filter in the DFR22 causes the detector to trigger on a slightly lower frequency band that includes the fundamental frequencies of most voiced sounds (vowels). The benefit of the improved weighting filter in the DFR22 is that it will not trigger on incidental mouth noisesThe AGC in the P4800 is different from the AGC in the DFR22 or DP11EQ because it does not include the speech detector. This allows the AGC to be a faster acting processor with shorter attack and decay times, but also makes it susceptible to noise floor pumping. One can approximate the performance of the P4800’s AGC by setting short attack and decay times in the DFR22 of DP11EQ. Short attack and decay times will effectively defeat the speech detector.How can the AGC be used for speech leveling?Often it is desired to get the benefits of the gradual change of AGC yet still have some short term leveling. A good way to accomplish this is to follow the AGC with a compressor. A compressor with a fast attack time will catch and squash peaks that pass through the AGC. If the compressor ratio is set to a moderate level (2:1, 3:1), the talker will still be able to generate a reasonable dynamic range."}

{"prompt":"I purchased a Shure phono cartridge and it will play fine for a few minutes then the audio will nearly cut out in one of the channels. If I pull the stylus and reseat it will come back for a little while then randomly cut out. I have replaced the head shell and lead wires and still get the same result. I have tried the turntable with a different head shell, cartridge and needle and do not get the same results. I have calibrated the cartridge with your protractor and verified that the overhang for my Technics table is at 52mm. Is there something else that I can try?","completion":"Failure of a phono cartridge is rare as there are only a few components inside of the body. There is a coil of wire for the left channel. There is a coil of wire for the right channel. There are two wires from each coil that connect to the output pins at the rear of the cartridge.  And there is a “tunnel” into which the stylus is inserted. Cutaway view of a moving magnet phono cartridge.Within the body, the only failure that is common (but not frequent) is when a wire to an output pin becomes disconnected. This cannot be repaired but can be easily tested: Testing a phono cartridge body.Looking at the stylus, the possible failures are also limited. The stylus shank can be bent or broken. The stylus support bushing can harden or become dislodged. The diamond tip can fall off (rare) or the magnet can fall off (extremely rare.) In each case, replacing the defective stylus with a new one will resolve the issue.When a customer claims that the Shure phono cartridge has failed or does not operate as expected, what is the root cause over 95% of the time? It is the wiring associated with the turntable. Here are the most common issues:  Corrosion on the headshell connectors that push onto the pins at the rear of the cartridge.Intermittent connection where the headshell connector is soldered to the associated wire.Intermittent connection where the headshell contacts mate with the tone arm contacts.Intermittent connection within the cable that links the turntable to the preamp/amplifier.Corrosion on the RCA plug / RCA jack used to link the turntable to the preamp/amplifier.Incorrect wiring within the turntable itself or within the tone arm headshell, including incorrect wire colors.Metal-to-metal, low voltage electrical connections corrode eventually.  It is inevitable and resistance is futile.  An electrical contact cleaner, such as DeOxit from CAIG Labs, can be useful."}

{"prompt":"What are some common KSM8 questions and answers?","completion":"The KSM8 has a wide \"sweet spot.\" What is a\"sweet spot\"?The \"sweet spot\" is an audio term that refers to the placement of a microphone, in reference to the vocal artist, for the most natural and balanced sound.  For a vocal microphone, this is critical as the sound quality will vary dependent on how the artist is holding the microphone.  If the artist is holding the mic too close, the audio can sound more muddy or unclear.  Conversely, if the microphone is too far away, the audio can sound thin and distant.  Proper microphone technique is a key element of good sound.  An artist can be inconsistent with microphone placement, and this may mean the sound engineer is required to process the microphone signal for better clarity or fidelity.The KSM8 has a wide sweet spot, due to the design of the Dualdyne element and its ability to control proximity effect.  Additionally, the neutral mid/high frequency response of the KSM8 requires little-or-no external signal processing - resulting in consistent, natural-sounding audio, regardless of the artist's mic technique.How does the KSM8 compare to the SM58 or Beta 58A?No one microphone is the solution to every problem.  Even with the KSM8 introduction, it is important to remember that the SM58 is still consistently chosen for a wide variety of vocal applications, from beginners to touring professionals, as the standard by which other microphones are measured. The Beta 58A, designed for increased gain-before-feedback due to its supercardioid polar pattern, offers a higher output level and hardened grille.  In a sound reinforcement system, the KSM8 addresses proximity effect (the build-up of bass frequencies) in a manner unique for dynamic microphones.What about the KSM8 polar pattern?  A consistent, uniform polar pattern provides better gain-before-feedback during live stage use.  Shure microphones are the benchmark for accurate polar patterns, resulting in exceptional consistency during performance. The design of the KSM8 Dualdyne cartridge creates a new standard for polar pattern uniformity.  This can be heard when one monitors the off-axis sound (stage-bleed) as picked up by the KSM8 cardioid polar pattern. The off-axis sound is uncolored and natural sounding.Why doesn't the KSM8 have switchable polar patterns like the KSM9?  Don't they both use dual diaphragm capsules?  The KSM8 is a dynamic microphone; the KSM9 is a condenser microphone. A dynamic microphone process sound waves mechanically whereas a condenser microphone does so electronically.  For a condenser, different polar patterns are achieved by changing the backplate voltage, shifting the capacitance, etc., - these manipulations are essentially electrical in nature.  Currently, there are no such equivalent mechanical processes for a dynamic microphone.Will there be other dynamic microphones with the Dualdyne cartridge technology?At this time, there are no plans for additional Dualdyne models.Is the KSM8 grill interchangeable with the KSM9 grill?No, the two grills have different dimensions and cannot be interchanged."}
{"prompt":"Can you tell me whether the Shure SM58 or Beta 58 would be better at reducing feedback for live vocals? Some tell me that the Beta would be better because it has a supercardioid pattern; others tell me the normal SM58 is better because it *doesn't* have a supercardioid pattern because the supercardioids apparently have a tail on the back of the pattern which picks up the sound from stage monitors. Also, is there another mic (hopefully in the SM58 or Beta 58 price range) that will do it's best to eliminate feedback? (I understand, of course, that feedback is a function of other speaker placement, EQ, room attributes, etc., but we're considering just the contribution of mics here.) If I must go above $200, what mic is the best for eliminating feedback? ","completion":"It is impossible to say that the SM58 or Beta 58A is better or worse at feedback rejection. The amount of rejection that each has is completely dependent on the physical relationship of the microphone versus the loudspeakers.Now, if the microphones are both in an ideal ambient field, the supercardioid would have slightly more rejection, because it is slightly less sensitive to ambient noise coming from all directions. In the ambient field, feedback acts just like any other ambient noise.The next part, though, is how the frequency response of the microphone interacts with the frequency response of the room and loudspeakers that are used. Those factors will also have an effect on which microphone will feed back first.Unfortunately, it is impossible to answer your question. The point of feedback for the SM58 and Beta 58A will be completely dependent on the room, loudspeakers, physical relationship, etc. We could easily get the SM58 to provide more gain before feedback in one situation, and then turn around and get the Beta 58A to provide more gain before feedback in a second situation. You cannot just consider the contribution of microphones when talking about feedback. Feedback only occurs when you have a complete sound system with all components interacting with each other. How these components interact will decide when feedback occurs.As an analogy, consider two cars. The first car has a 4 cylinder engine that produces 190 horsepower. The second car has a V8 that produces 300 horsepower. Now, which car goes faster? Well, if the first car only weighs 1500 pounds (typical for a race car) and the second car weighs 3000 pounds (typical for a street car), the smaller, less powerful car will actually win. So, it's not just how much power the engine has, but how the engine, car, transmission, et al, interact together.More information: How do I fix my feedback problem?"}

{"prompt":"What is Dante Clocking and how do I set it up?","completion":"Introduction to Dante ClockingClocking is a critical part of all digital audio systems. Every digital audio device contains a clock, which is used to accurately time out the capture and playback of digital audio samples, much like a metronome helps a musician keep time. When multiple digital audio devices are connected together, they all need to share a common reference to make sure that audio is captured and played back in sync. Dante achieves this using the Precision Time Protocol, which is also known as PTPv1 or IEEE1588-2002.In a Dante network, one device is assigned the role of Primary Leader Clock, and the rest of the devices will synchronize their internal clock to the Primary Leader Clock. This device can either be elected automatically by way of the PTP protocol, or it can be manually selected by a user in Dante Controller.Unless a network has hundreds of devices, any Dante device can serve as the Primary Leader Clock without any performance penalty. It's best to select a stable device which is unlikely to be rebooted or turned off as the Primary Leader Clock to avoid audio glitches on the network if the Primary Leader Clock role is transferred to a new device.The Primary Leader Clock does not need to be synchronized to any particular real-world time source, such as GPS. All that matters is that the device can maintain precise time over long periods, like a good wristwatch does. This ensures that audio is always captured and played back accurately. All Dante devices have dedicated chips on board to handle this task.How do I set up Dante clocking?As previously mentioned, in a normal Dante network one device will automatically be selected as the Primary Leader Clock. If you have a preference for which device or devices should be the preferred clock, then select those in Dante Controller on the Clock tab. Ensure that one and only one device is listed as the Primary Leader Clock, at the top of the Dante Controller screen.Troubleshooting Clock IssuesThe PTP clock protocol relies on Multicast IP traffic to communicate among devices on a Dante network. It also assumes that Ethernet switches will consistently pass the clock packets to their destination immediately upon receiving one. While most unmanaged Ethernet switches handle this task well, some do not. The two most common causes are Energy Efficient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az, or Green Ethernet), and incorrectly configured Multicast settings.Be sure that the network switch you purchase for Dante networks is not on our disqualified list. In addition, check the product documentation to ensure that the switch does not have Energy Efficient Ethernet, Green Ethernet, or 802.3az--or that it can be disabled if it does.If the switch supports configuration, you may need to disable all Multicast Filtering for smaller networks of Dante-only devices. For larger networks or networks with AES67, see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping, and our Enterprise Network Troubleshooting Checklist.In some cases, it may be necessary to isolate Dante Clock traffic to a small network.For the curious, we have a more detailed FAQ on clocking: Dante and AES Clocking In Depth."}

Am I really at risk of cancer if I use this product?Please do not be unnecessarily alarmed by this label - at least in regards to our products - for the following reasons:For many, if not most, of the chemicals on the State's list, there are no minimum threshold limits on quantities that trigger the requirement for a warning.The State of California has not provided comprehensive guidance as to when the warning is required in all circumstances. Therefore, to be abundantly cautious, Shure has decided to place the warning on certain products.Shure does not believe its products pose an unreasonable risk to users, but Shure wants its customers to be fully apprised.For more information about Proposition 65, you may wish to visit the Proposition 65 section of the website of the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) at www.oehha.ca.gov."}

{"prompt":"How do I troubleshoot and fix the hum in my hi-fi system that has a turntable?","completion":"SOURCES OF HUMIt is difficult to answer the question \"What makes my hi-fi system hum?\" because there are many possible causes. However, the cures are simple and will eliminate hum in many cases when the outline below is followed:Turn down volume control. If hum persists, it is originating in the power amplifier or interconnections.  Service may be required.   If  hum decreases as volume is turned down, proceed to next step.There must be a connection from the metal parts of the turntable to the chassis of the preamp/amplifier; from there to ground on a water pipe, a grounded electric outlet box, or a radiator. Also, try reversing the AC plugs on the amplifier, the turntable, and the preamp. If hum persists, proceed to next step.Disconnect the phonograph plugs from the preamp or amplifier. If the hum persists, or is present when a tuner or tape recorder is played through the system, the problem is localized in the preamp or amplifier.  Service may be required. If  hum disappears, reinsert the plugs, proceed to next step.Check to see that the turntable is not located next to, on top of, or underneath a power amplifier, tuner, tape recorder, or any item using a transformer or motor. A transformer or motor can create a localized hum field.  If hum persists with the turntable isolated, proceed to next step.Turn the turntable motor On and Off. If hum disappears when motor is Off, the motor has an excessive hum field. This situation is rare, except when a magnetic pickup has been installed in a vintage turntable designed for ceramic pickups. If hum is present when motor is Off, proceed to next step.If hum increases when a human hand is brought near the phono cartridge headshell, it is likely that the metal shield in the cartridge is not being grounded by the connections.  If a plastic headshell is used, the metal grounding clip on the cartridge terminal marked \"RG\" should be in place. If a metal shell is used, and the hum is steady, removing the grounding clip may help. If the hum persists, replace the clip and proceed to next step.Check the cable connections on the underside of the phonograph base. There should be no connection from the shield of the cables to the metal turntable parts, If there is, remove it and install a separate ground wire, as in Step 2.If the tonearm wiring has only three wires, or two shielded wires with the shields connected, then a special three-wire cable should be used between phonograph and amplifier. Alternately, two single conductor shielded wires may be used if the shield of one is left \"floating\" at the phonograph.  If these steps do not cure the trouble, try a different cartridge. Though unlikely, there could be an internal grounding problem within the phono cartridge body."}

{"prompt":"Is there a \"secret spot\" on the SM58 where the serial number is placed?","completion":"There is no serial number on the SM58 microphone nor on most Shure microphones. There is a serial number on the outside of the box that the SM58 comes in.There is a \"date code\" of two letter combinations inside the microphone. If you carefully unscrew the handle in the middle, there is a small circuit board with wires going to the connector. There are two letters stamped on the circuit board. The \"date code\" indicates the month and year of manufacture. However, the dates coding used have changed multiple times over the decades, so unless the general age of the mic is known, the date code is of little value."}
{"prompt":"How long has the V15 been in production? What are the model differences?","completion":"A brief history of the V15:V15 1964-1966V15 Type II 1966-1970V15 Type II Improved 1970-1973V15 Type III 1973-1978V15 Type IV 1978-1982V15 Type V 1982-1983V15 Type V-MR 1983-1993V15 Type VxMR 1996-2005One distinctive difference between each generation of the V15 is the shape and dimensions of the Pole Pieces and Stylus Brass Housing. This means that the styli are not interchangeable from one generation to the next. They do not provide a proper fit, or alignment, between the Magnet and Pole Pieces.In 1983, Shure introduced the Micro-Ridge (MR) diamond for the V15 Type V. Shure also offered the Micro-Ridge diamond on replacement styli for V15 Type III and Type IV. Again, long term quantities were estimated and produced. Circumstantially, the tooling for the V15 Type V allowed for additional production of Type III replacement styli. This accounts for the larger availability of Type III and Type V replacement styli.Shure experienced dramatic shifts in demand for phono cartridges when the CD Player was introduced in the late 1980’s. In the early 1990’s cartridge sales plummeted, OEM business ceased, and Shure gave serious consideration to ending all phono production.In 1995, under new phono management, Shure re-engineered our phono products and manufacturing process to allow us to produce significantly lower quantities, maintain our quality standards, locate reliable suppliers, and maintain a fair market price. The action allowed Shure to remain in the phono cartridge business, but unfortunately, required that we cease to support pre-1995 products beyond the final inventory build-ups.For V15 products, a replacement stylus was typically available for years after the cartridge was officially discontinued. Some inventory usually remained in the retail channel for 2-3 years.Shure’s inventory of VN45E, VN45HE, and VN45MR styli completely expired in the late 1990’s. We are unable to re-produce this part due to scarcity of tooling and raw materials.The V15VxMR, was discontinued in 2005. "}

{"prompt":"I have a question about microphone shielding. In one small area of my studio (near my mains circuit breaker/electrical panel) I have some type of electrical interference and all my microphones except the Neumann mics have hum when turned in a certain direction. If I turn the mics 90 degrees, the hum disappears. The Neumann mics (U87s and U64s) have no hum in any direction and work fine. The SM57 and EV 635 that I have has this hum in this same placement. Do you think the hum comes from mic transformers that are not shielded or not shielded enough?","completion":"The likely source of the problem is a hum field in your studio caused by the AC power lines.Any type of dynamic mic, like the Shure SM57 or EV 635, contains a voice coil that is very susceptible to picking up the hum field. Nothing can be added to these mics to control this.Some dynamic mics contain an internal hum bucking coil, like the Shure SM7B, that reduces hum pick-up....reduces, not eliminates. Some dynamic mics, like the Shure Beta 58, have more effective shielding around the voice coil; that also reduces hum.But ALL dynamic mics will pick up this hum field to some extent.Condenser mics, like the Neumann's or the Shure KSM mics, do not have voice coils. These mics will perform much better in a hum field. But many of these mics have output transformers that, like a voice coil, will also pick up the hum.If the hum field cannot be eliminated, stick with high quality condenser mics with transformerless outputs. The Shure KSM mics are condenser mics with transformerless outputs."}
{"prompt":"Will a QLX-D transmitter work with a ULX-D receiver and vice versa?","completion":"Yes, but both devices must have the same operating frequency band, such as G50.  Group and Channel settings within the frequency band are the same for ULX-D and QLX-D.The Group and Channel number for each device have to be set manually, as the InfraRed sync will not work.  Also, the encryption feature is not available with this type of \"hybrid\" system."}
{"prompt":"We are building a new conference room in our facility. Are there guidelines on the acoustic qualities of the room that we should be taken into account?","completion":"To maximize the success of any conferencing facility, a number of factors must be considered during planning and implementation. The list includes:Acoustic qualities - room noise floor, external noise sources, technical noise (projectors, fans), building noise (e.g. HVAC), and reverberation qualitiesLighting - configurations for different types of meeting scenarios including video projection or video conferencingComfort Level - space per occupant (square feet), furniture, HVACVisual - Projection systems and video conferencing monitor sight lines, general aestheticsFollowing is a brief discussion of the acoustic qualities issue:Signal to noise is a metric that takes into account the ambient noise of a room, which includes any undesired sounds that can be heard or measured. This includes noise from heating/ventilating/air conditioning, building mechanical systems (e.g. elevators), technical (e.g. projectors, lighting control systems, etc.), and sounds from outside the room (such as airplanes, cars/trucks, weather, adjacent noisy spaces, e.g. cafeterias and mechanical rooms). The general industry guideline for the absolute minimum signal to noise metric in a conference room is 20 dB. For best results, the conference room facility should be designed for a signal to noise metric of at least 25 dB. More is definitely better!Example 1 - the noise floor in a room measures 55 dB SPL A weighted (slow). If normal speech is assumed to be 70 dB SPL A weighted (slow), then the signal to noise metric of the room is 70-55 or 15 dB. This room will be challenging for conference use.Example 2 - the noise floor in a room measures 42 dB SPL A weighted (slow). If normal speech is assumed to be 70 dB SPL A weighted (slow), then the signal to noise metric of the room is 70-42 or 28 dB. This room is an excellent candidate for conferencing.Technical noise in a conference room is often overlooked. Technical noise can come from video projectors, computers, and other audio/video support equipment. Often times, the offending noise is from cooling fans in the A/V equipment. Fans generally produce a broad-spectrum noise that is similar to the sound produced by sound masking systems. Fan noise can be very annoying as well as detrimental to intelligibility and clarity in hearing. Every effort should be made to silence technical equipment or to specify/install quiet equipment in the conference room.Similarly, HVAC systems can produce high levels of broad-spectrum noise. Air movement systems should be carefully engineered to minimize air velocity in ducts and through diffusers. Isolating mechanical noise from air handlers is also important - this type of noise can come through the ductwork as well as mechanically through the building structure.Some building materials and room shapes that will often cause acoustical problems include:Large glass surfaces - walls or windowsLarge drywall surfacesLarge marker board surfacesNon-sound-absorptive ceiling materialConcave wall or ceiling shapesThe reverberation characteristics of a conference room are very important. These construction materials and characteristics can contribute to excessive sound reflections that will detract from a quality meeting experience. Proper design will yield a room that minimizes reverberation, but is also not too \"dead-sounding.\"Utilizing an acoustical consultant to work with the architect in specifying the room design will be money well spent.For additional information on Conference and Meeting Rooms, refer to Shure's Educational Brochure \"Audio Systems Guide for Meeting Facilities.\""}
{"prompt":"What is the procedure to calibrate the VU meter on a Shure mixer?","completion":"How to Calibrate the VU Meter on a Shure MixerWhy does a VU meter require calibration?A VU meter indicates the signal level being sent from the mixer to the next device. A VU meter can be calibrated to any reference level desired. In the United States, the most common reference level is 0VU = +4dBm. That is, when the VU meter needle is lined up with 0 reading on the meter face, the audio signal at the output of the mixer has a level of +4dBm. Please note that the 0 indication on any VU meter has no pre-determined value. 0 VU is simply a point of reference.What does +4dBm equal in volts?+4dBm equals a signal voltage of 1.23 volts measured across a 600 ohm load.What is required to calibrate a VU meter for a reference level of 0VU = +4dBm?In addition to basic soldering skills, a soldering iron, and solder, you will require:A multimeter that can accurately measure audio signal levels at 1,000 Hz. An example is Radio Shack multimeter #22-174. As of September 2001, this meter has a price of $90. Do not use inexpensive multimeters as the calibration will not be accurate!A 600 ohm load resistor. Create a 600 ohm resistor by using one 270 ohm resistor (Radio Shack #271-1112) and one 330 ohm resistor (Radio Shack #271-1113). Solder the lead of one resistor to one lead of the other. This puts the resistors in series and their values add together to create a \"new\" resistor with a value of 600 ohms.An XLR female connector (Radio Shack #274-011) to mate with the mixer's male XLR output connector. Remove the outer metal shell of the female XLR connector as it will not be used. Solder one lead of the 600 ohm resistor to pin 2 of the female XLR connector. Solder the other lead of the 600 ohm resistor to pin 3 of the female XLR connector.A set of insulated alligator clip test leads (Radio Shack #278-001) to connect the multimeter to the 600 ohm load.What are the steps for calibration?Set the XLR output level of the mixer to LINE.Connect the female XLR connector with the 600 ohm load to the mixer's XLR output.Using the alligator clip test leads, connect one multimeter probe to pin 2 of the female XLR. Connect the other multimeter probe to pin 3 of the female XLR.Power up the multimeter and set it to read AC voltage.Power up the mixer.Turn on the mixer's 1kHz tone oscillator.Turn up the mixer's Master control until the multimeter reads 1.23 volts. Note: on some mixers you may also have to turn up the level control for input #1. In that case, set the Master to the middle of its range and turn up input #1 until the multimeter reads 1.23 volts.With the multimeter reading 1.23 volts (or as close as possible), adjust the mixer's VU calibration control until the meter reads 0 VU. See your mixer's User Guide to find the location of the VU calibration adjustments.If you have a stereo mixer, do this same calibration for the Left output and the Right output. Make certain the channel pan pots are in the center position.What are other common calibration levels besides +4dBm?+8dBm = 1.95 volts; 0dBm = 0.775 volts"}

No one has given me a convincing reason for this, other than 'That's just what you do- everyone does it this way'. Please ease my anxious mind!","completion":"The SM57 and SM58 microphones are based on the same cartridge design. The main difference is in the grille design. The SM58 was designed for vocal application and it uses a ball grille that acts as an effective pop filter. The SM57 was designed as an instrument microphone where a smaller grille size is preferred. In this application, pop and wind are not usually a concern.The SM57 uses an integral resonator/grille assembly, where grille is actually a part of the cartridge. These two grille designs place the diaphragm of each microphone in a different acoustical environment. The distance from the top of the grille to the diaphragm is shorter on the SM57 compared to that of the SM58. This allows for a closer miking position with a more pronounced proximity effect. The different resonator/grille assembly design of the SM57 is also responsible for its slightly higher output above 5 kHz."}
{"prompt":"I just purchased Shure earphones. What is the procedure to remove the flexible sleeves?","completion":"Shure earphones are packaged with sleeves on the stems. During periods of storage and shipping, the sleeves can adhere to the stems. Given the choice between a sleeve that is difficult to remove and a sleeve that easily comes off, the difficult-to-remove sleeve is preferred so that it does not accidentally detach and remain in the ear canal.Please try the methods below and in this order:Method 1: Most of the time, it will work best to get a finger nail behind the sleeve and pull the sleeve off the stem. \"Walk\" the sleeve off the stem by moving the fingernail from one side of the stem to the other. While pulling upward with the fingernails, rotate the earphone with the other hand.Method 2: Use a shirt, a towel, or paper towel to securely grasp the sleeve. Twist and pull the sleeve away from the nozzle while gently rocking the sleeve from left to right.Method 3: Place the earphones in the freezer overnight. The plastic will shrink slightly and break the adhesion between the sleeve and the nozzle. The cold temperature will not damage the earphones. Be careful: Do not break off the earphone nozzle.Method 4: This method will ruin the flexible sleeve.  Use a staple remover.  Clamp it around the flexible sleeve and gently pull upward. The earphone stem is small enough to fit the gap in the middle of the staple remover jaws.Try method 1 first. Method 2 and Method 3 have a risk of breaking the earphone nozzle. Thus, we strongly recommend method 1.If these methods do not work, contact Shure Service for replacement/repair."}
{"prompt":"I have two MX418D/S microphones with an odd problem. When the gooseneck is touched or moved, it will sound like a tight guitar string being plucked, or like a really bad guitar string when the gooseneck is tapped. Any ideas?","completion":"It could be that the cable within the gooseneck was pulled tightly during assembly and is trapped under the printed circuit board in the mic base. The cable will be stretched tight when the gooseneck is straightened and can vibrate like a guitar string. This can be remedied as long as the cable within the gooseneck has not been damaged.Use a #2 Phillips head screwdriver to open the mic base;  use a #1 Phillips head screwdriver to loosen the printed circuit board. Free the cable and make certain it moves freely as the gooseneck is moved. If feasible, push some cable up into the gooseneck to provide slack cable within the gooseneck. To help keep the slack cable up in the gooseneck, the gooseneck opening can be filled with foam rubber, a pipe cleaner, or some other type of compressible material. Reassemble the base to the mic.  Make certain the internal cables don't get caught or pinched when the base is put back on.NOTE: The mic will not work until re-assembled; the metal base plate provides the ground path for the audio circuit."}

With two transmitters on the same frequency, only one of the two can be powered up at any moment in time. If both are powered up, the two RF signals will \"jam\" each other."}
{"prompt":"Are there any recommend settings or best practices when using the MXA910?","completion":"The MXA910 is designed to work well “out of the box” for most rooms without significant configuration. However, before installing or commissioning an MXA910, we recommend completing the MXA910/MXA310 Training and Certification. This free course through the Shure Audio Institute explains how the MXA910 works and walks you through the setup process. It also answers any common questions you may have.Shure recommends using Shure Designer to configure all MXA910 microphones, even those already deployed in the field. Designer allows you to import a floor plan, set it to scale, and then place your MXA910 microphones where they actually are in the room—making it easy to visualize lobe placement and audio coverage. Designer also works with the IntelliMix P300 and IntelliMix Room processors to optimize the audio flow and settings, all from one tool. The MXA910 User’s Guide has detailed setup instructions using Designer in the Getting Started section. We recommend starting with this before making major changes to the MXA910 configuration.Once you’ve gone through the basic configuration using Shure Designer, evaluate the sound of the microphone and determine if it’s acceptable. While you can do this via a test call through the room's conferencing system, be aware that the audio codec’s compression artifacts may color the sound making it hard to judge just the mic. The same goes for using a third-party DSP if that DSP isn't configured properly. Instead, we recommend listening to the mic in the room with a good pair of headphones. The easiest way to listen is with a Dante-enabled headphone amplifier (see Listen to Dante Signals in Headphones), but you can also use your computer’s headphone jack to listen to the USB output of an IntelliMix P300 (see Listen to P300 in Headphones), or directly to the MXA910 with Dante Virtual Soundcard (see Listening to Audio with Dante Virtual Soundcard).If you find that you cannot get the MXA910 to sound good after following the steps above, then we encourage you to contact your Shure Sales Representative or Shure Applications Engineering for further assistance.MXA910 Default Settings (v4.4 Firmware)These are the default, out of the box settings for the MXA910. These are Shure’s recommended settings. If you experience issues, we recommend resetting your MXA910 to these settings and listening to the audio.Coverage PatternThe MXA910 by default covers a 30’ x 30’ (10m x 10m) room.

{"prompt":"Why is Stem Speaker not available in the RoomDesign tool?","completion":"The purpose of the RoomDesign tool is to accurately determine pick-up ranges for microphones in a given space/room. Stem Speaker is not included in RoomDesign because it does not have a microphone."}
{"prompt":"What’s the coverage of Stem Speaker and how can I configure it?","completion":"The maximum SPL of the Stem Speaker is 102db and the frequency response is 60hz-20khz. The pick-up range for each Stem Speaker will vary based on the acoustics of the room.Note: No extra configuration is required, you will simply pair the unit to the room like you do with other Stem devices."}
{"prompt":"Is Stem Table USB-powered?","completion":"No. For power, all Stem Ecosystem devices require a PoE+ ethernet connection."}
{"prompt":"Can Stem Wall be used as a traditional sound bar?","completion":"The Stem Wall can be used for all computer play back audio via the USB connection. It cannot be attached to a television as its sound bar."}
{"prompt":"What is the best mounting orientation for a Stem Wall unit?","completion":"The ideal mounting location for a Stem Wall is horizontally mounted to a wall surface between 3 ft and 7 ft from the floor. However, Stem Wall offers microphone pick-up with 180 degrees of verticality. This means that you can place it almost anywhere on your wall (high or low) and the pickup will be there!"}
{"prompt":"How does audio fencing perform in a reverberant room? Does it help cut out reverb?","completion":"It does help, though it is subjective to the listener, and it is subject to many factors, such as the limitations of the acoustics in the room. Extremely reverberant rooms always should be tested prior and potentially treated acoustically to improve the quality of sound within the room."}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between the three beam options and audio fencing mode on the Stem Ceiling?","completion":"On the Stem Ceiling, there are three different beam sizes as well as an audio fencing mode (which locks the beam).Wide Beam (60 degrees) - This setting will allow the beam to be at the widest that the device can achieve.Medium Beam (45 degrees) - This setting will keep the beam in a nice middle ground between the widest and most narrow beam options. You may still be able to hear someone that was perfectly audible with the widest beam, but audio will not be as clean. Often this setting helps with acoustically challenged spaces.Narrow Beam (20 degrees) - This setting will tell the device to listen to its most narrow beam first. You may still be able to hear someone from the wide or medium beam, but the audio will be less clear the further they move from the beam.Audio Fencing (20 degrees) - When you enable the fencing mode, the device will lock its beam into the narrowest configuration and not allow you to adjust it until you manually disable fencing mode. With audio fencing, if you are not speaking within the narrow beam, your audio is not picked up at all."}
{"prompt":"What accessories does Stem Ceiling come with? How is it suspended from the ceiling?","completion":"With each Stem Ceiling you will receive a chandelier suspension kit, sqaure ceiling mount, Gripple kit, USB cable A-B, and ethernet cable. There are two mounting options for Stem Ceiling that come within the packaging: Low-Profile and Suspended Chandelier. For further details, please refer to the Stem Ceiling User-Manual.Note: Stem Ceiling tile and hardware is going through the process of plenum (UL2043) certification."}
{"prompt":"Is it possible to customize the screen on Stem Control? For example, can I hide buttons other than Zoom Rooms on the web conferencing screen?","completion":"After configuration, Stem Control can be locked (via the lock icon in the bottom left of the screen) in the ‘Video Conf’ or ‘Dialer’ so that only an authorized user with the Organization Password can leave those pages. No other customization is available."}
{"prompt":"Why can’t I see my Stem devices on Stem Control?","completion":"This is most commonly seen if your Stem Control is running an outdated firmware version or on a different subnet. To find the firmware version of each unit, go to Ecosystem > Devices > Desired Device. Please make sure you are running the latest firmware version and contact your IT admin to ensure all devices are connected to the same subnet."}
{"prompt":"What OS is on the Stem Control unit?","completion":"Stem Control runs on Android."}
{"prompt":"Can I connect a USB camera to Stem Control and organize a complete solution for a meeting room with audio and video?","completion":"No. The Stem Control is designed to be a tool to assist with the configuration and management of your Stem Ecosystems devices in a room and to be the SIP and video conferencing one-touch interface. There is no ability to plug in anything but a PoE+ ethernet cable for power and data."}
{"prompt":"Do I always need Stem Control as part of a Stem Ecosystem installation?","completion":"The Stem Control is a great tool meant to assist with configuration and management of your Stem Ecosystem. However, almost all functions that can be done from the Stem Control touch screen panel could also be done from within the Stem Ecosystem platform (log into the IP address of any device via a web browser). For SIP functionality having a Stem Control in the room is most practical since it gives the end-user a tangible dialer keypad. For video conference applications such as Zoom Rooms, a Stem Control is required.Stem Control does three main things:Video conference integrationSIP dialing/callingStem Ecosystem Configuration optionsMicrophone testing and calibration (Room Test and RoomAdapt)Room Creation/Room JoinConfiguration of settingsScheduled Restarts / Scheduled TestingAutomatic Firmware UpdatesEcosystem Static IP assignments"}
{"prompt":"Stem Hub only has USB, no analog in?","completion":"There is not an analog input, Stem is really designed for USB audio connectivity. Stem Hub has a USB connection to connect to a PC, terminal blocks for output to external speakers, and a single Dante channel in and out."}
{"prompt":"Do external Dante loudspeakers require Stem Hub?","completion":"If you want to connect the Stem Ecosystem to a Dante network, you'll need Stem Hub. It’s the only device that provides Dante connectivity."}
{"prompt":"Does Stem Hub do any automixing? Does it mix the signals from all devices together or does it take the signal from one device only?","completion":"Stem Hub’s primary function is to work together with all the devices in the ecosystem to provide the far-end with the clearest audio signal that is picked up from the room. Taking the audio pick-up from all the microphones and creating one single and final stream of audio. This is not just a simple mix, there is quite a bit of intelligence in the algorithms."}
{"prompt":"How do I get presentation audio (and not just the mics) into Stem Hub?","completion":"The USB connection to the presentation computer would be the way to get presentation audio to the Stem Ecosystem devices. Just make sure Stem Hub is assigned as the default speaker (output) for your computer and all audio will be running out of the devices."}
{"prompt":"Does the line level output on Stem Hub only reproduce far-end audio?","completion":"Yes, but to be more complete, the Line Out on Stem Hub will send far-end audio and (permitting USB connection to a computer) all audio being sent via the computer (when Stem Hub is assigned as the default speaker for the computer)."}
{"prompt":"Is the L/R line output on Stem Hub sending two separate mono signals or a stereo signal?","completion":"Stem Ecosystem devices use mono signals, so the L/R is a 5-pin, dual mono, terminal block connection that sends two identical mono signals with a common ground."}
{"prompt":"How many devices does each Stem Hub support?","completion":"Stem Hub can support up to 10 audio endpoints devices (Table, Wall, Ceiling, Speaker), provided it is running at least firmware version 2.0. Stem Control and Stem Hub do not count as an audio endpoint device."}
{"prompt":"When do I need a Stem Hub?","completion":"A Stem Hub is required in every multi-device setup. It is also required for use with external speakers, or in a setup that will only contain a Stem Ceiling and external speakers (to prevent echo). When the Hub is required, it will also be the only device which needs to connect via USB to a computer."}
{"prompt":"Is AES67 encryption supported on the Dante stream of the Stem ecosystem?","completion":"No, AES67 is not supported on the Dante stream."}
{"prompt":"Can Dante run on the same network as the Stem Ecosystem or does it require an additional switch?","completion":"The Stem Ecosystem can run from the same switch for Dante and device communication provided that the switch can handle the additional bandwidth needed for Dante (and that the switch is PoE+). It is often recommended to place Stem Ecosystem devices in an alternate VLAN to ensure there are no bandwidth issues."}
{"prompt":"Does Stem Hub mix Dante channels into the audio going to the USB port?","completion":"USB functionality and Dante are not intended for use simultaneously. You can use USB or Dante, but cannot use both at the same time."}
{"prompt":"Does Stem Hub only stream Dante out or can it also have a Dante input?","completion":"The Dante port on Stem Hub provides a single Dante channel out (transmitting) and a single Dante channel in (receiving)."}
{"prompt":"Is Stem Hub’s Dante feature built-in and available at all times?","completion":"Dante functionality within Stem Hub routes through one of the two physical RJ45 ports on the unit that is labeled Dante. The Dante I/O is a 1x1, meaning a single channel output as well as a single channel input. Keep in mind that a soft reboot of Stem devices will disable the Dante port, and a hard reboot (removing the ethernet cable) will be needed to fully reset."}
{"prompt":"Can you use Dante if there is no USB connection from Stem Hub?","completion":"Yes. It is recommended that you use Dante only when there is no USB connection between the Hub and computer to prevent echo in existing speakers."}
{"prompt":"Are the LED colors on the Stem devices changeable?","completion":"No, pick-up is in blue, mute is red. However, LED lights can be turned off if it is undesirable."}
{"prompt":"What do the LED lights in Stem devices indicate?","completion":"Blue lights indicate the unit is powered on and functional. On the Stem Table and Wall, the blue LEDs track audio, the lights will light up depending on where audio is coming from – for Table and Wall the blue tracking lights can be turned off. The audio tracking feature is not available for the Ceiling unit, the unit will always show a solid blue light – for Ceiling the blue LED light cannot be turned off. Solid red indicates the Table, Wall, and Ceiling is muted.Note: For exact details on different light behaviors and indications, please visit the Stem Ecosystem User-Manual."}
{"prompt":"How can I hard reboot Stem devices?","completion":"A soft reboot for Stem devices is possible through the Stem Ecosystem platform. A hard reboot (power cycle) is only possible by unplugging the ethernet cable from the back of the unit or from the switch."}
{"prompt":"Can I daisy-chain devices?","completion":"It is not possible to daisy chain Stem Ecosystem devices in any way. However, as networkable devices, you can pair up to 10 audio endpoints (Stem Table, Wall, Ceiling, Speaker) to one Stem Hub."}
{"prompt":"Why does Stem Control have a different firmware version than the rest of the devices?","completion":"Stem Control reflects the software version that manages the Stem Ecosystem application, meanwhile audio endpoints (Stem Hub, Table, Wall, Ceiling, and Speaker) reflect the firmware version for the Microphone / Speaker Operating System."}
{"prompt":"How do I find the firmware version on my Stem devices?","completion":"There are 2 ways to see firmware versions on a given device:Open the Stem Upgrader, all units on the same subnet as the computer running the app will be displayed with their MAC address, serial number, IP address and firmware version number.Log into any device’s IP address (via a web browser) and select the individual device from within the ecosystem platform. Listed for each unit will be its name, serial number, MAC address, IP address and firmware version number."}
{"prompt":"Is there latency between Stem audio devices?","completion":"When communicating over the network, Stem devices present some minimal latency accounted for at 120-200ms. Latency is variable based on the specifics of the network. For optimal performance, please contact your IT/network administrator."}
{"prompt":"What type of security/encryption is used for the Stem ecosystem?","completion":"All Stem Ecosystem audio traffic uses AES-128 encryption."}
{"prompt":"Are Stem Ecosystem devices able to communicate across VLANs?","completion":"All devices in a given room must be on the same VLAN. The devices are not capable to communicate across VLANs on their own. They are not capable of browsing VLANs without the network team allowing their VLAN to have open communication with the other VLANs on the given network."}
{"prompt":"Do I need a DHCP switch for Stem devices?","completion":"Yes. DHCP is required. Stem Ecosystem devices are looking for a true DHCP server or a standard router. If you are running a multi-device setup, you will also require a PoE+ switch so that the units can see/talk with each other from the same network.Note: Stem products do not support link local (or fall back) addresses."}
{"prompt":"How do I find the IP address of my device?","completion":"For Stem Table and Stem Wall devices, you can press the Volume Up and Volume Down button simultaneously for 5 seconds and the device will read out its IP address (supported in firmware 1.4.0 and later).Devices that do not have speakers or physical buttons require the Stem Upgrader 2.0 or the ability to look into the network that the units are connected to.Open the Stem Upgrader 2.0. All devices on the same subnet as the computer running the app will be displayed with their MAC address, serial Number, IP address and firmware version number.If you need to look into the network, be sure to contact your IT administrator. There are quite a few options that could be used to discover the units, IT will be able to assist with the best option or possibly find the unit for you!To assist IT/yourself with locating the unit, have the MAC address of the unit you are looking for readily available as that is the best identifier for any device on a network."}
{"prompt":"Are Stem devices PoE or PoE+ powered?","completion":"The Stem Hub, Stem Ceiling, Stem Table, and Stem Wall require PoE+ power for full functionality. Using PoE instead of PoE+ will lead to audio issues with the devices since they won’t have access to the full range of Power over Ethernet they may require during use."}
{"prompt":"Do I need to download any software?","completion":"There is no requirement for software to be downloaded and installed. However, as a helpful resource for your install you can download the Stem Upgrader (available in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10)."}

{"prompt":"Is there an available API for control of Stem devices?","completion":"There is not a publicly available API."}
{"prompt":"Can I remotely access and control Stem Ecosystem devices?","completion":"Absolutely, yes! Remote access via a web browser is a great way to manage the platform and is available from any of the device’s IP addresses (except Stem Control). The only requirements are that your VLAN is internet facing or that you have the ability to remote into that subnet/VLAN."}
{"prompt":"Will I lose any configurability in a standalone / single device Stem setup?","completion":"All configuration options are available if you are using a single unit in standalone as well as a multi-device setup including a Stem Hub. The only functionality that would not be present in a standalone setup compared to a multi-device setup would be the ability to add external speakers."}
{"prompt":"Do Stem devices require the internet to function?","completion":"Internet access is required for:SIP functionality‘Video Conf’ within Stem Control to connect those integrationsRunning auto-updates for device firmware (offline updates are also possible!)When using a standalone device, you can completely isolate the device from the internet (PoE+ injector for power, USB for computer connection required).In a multi-device setup, the devices require a localized network to see/talk with each other in real time, internet access is not required for this to work."}
{"prompt":"How many Stem Ecosystem devices can I use in a room in total?","completion":"The maximum number of audio endpoints allowed on one Stem Hub is 10. This number does not include Stem Control or Stem Hub. This means that you could have a potential of 12-13 devices in a given room (Joined room’s Hub + primary Hub + Stem Control)."}
{"prompt":"What's the difference between a Beta 57A and a Beta 58A?","completion":"The form factor of the mics is different; basically, the grille and the label. The different grilles make the response of these two microphones slightly different in the higher frequencies. In addition, the Beta 57A grille allows a little closer placement of the microphone cartridge, which translates to higher output, more gain before feedback, and a more bass response, i.e. proximity effect.The Beta 57A grill and the Beta 58A grill are interchangeable."}
{"prompt":"What accessories or components do I need for a complete SM7B setup?","completion":"You'll need a few things to complete any SM7B setup:A mic stand, boom arm, or mount: Check out SM7B: How can I mount this microphone? Are there special stands available?A computer interface or mixer. Take a look at Microphone connected to a computer sound card for Shure-brand options. For multiple-mic setups, there are many good third-party interfaces available with inputs ranging from two to sixteen or more.A preamplifier. If your interface doesn't offer 60 dB of clean gain, you'll want a preamp. Check out SM7B Output Level and Preamp Gain Specifications.An XLR cable to connect the SM7B to the computer interface or mixer. Any XLR cable will work, but one with \"star-quad\" type shielding will generally offer the best performance.If recording to a computer, you'll need software.

As of this writing, Shure has tested compatibility with the Belkin Ethernet + Power Adapter with Lightning Connector.  "}
{"prompt":"Which Shure studio microphone would be best suited to recording spoken voice in an environment where there is background office noise/traffic noise at a level of approximately -32dB when the voice level is at 0dB. I've been through all of the pages on the web site and am inclined towards testing the following models: Beta 58A, SM58, Beta 57A, KSM32, SM7B. Can you give me any guidance among these models as to which might be particularly well-suited to this task? I want to maintain a warm vocal sound while minimizing ambient leakage.","completion":"If the background noise is non-directional, then a supercardioid microphone will provide the most rejection. All of our Beta microphones are supercardioid.The KSM32 and SM7B will provide more of a warm bodied sound than the Beta microphones, but have cardioid polar patterns.For a comparison of the different polar patterns, download our online booklet \"Microphone Techniques for Music - Sound Reinforcement\".Page 9 of the booklet has a chart that compares polar patterns, including each pattern's sensitivity to ambient sound.You might also want to consider constructing a 3 sided enclosure (about a 2 foot cube) to sit on the table and surround the microphone position to help isolate it from the room. Placing acoustical absorptive material on the inside of the enclosure is highly recommended."}
{"prompt":"1) I need to get a wireless microphone system for instructing purposes and needed to find out which Shure system is recommended. 2) In particular I need to find out whether or not there is any guidance from Shure about the microphone model recommended being exposed to sweat. 3) Are any Shure models are guaranteed against sweat damage?","completion":"BLX14 with the SM31FH headset. Most often used for this application due to the low price point.The SM31FH mic is the most durable. The transmitter pack should be kept in a belt or arm pouch to keep sweat away - the Shure belt pouch is the model WA570A and the arm pouch is the model WA620. Choosing the correct position for the transmitter pack is key in preventing sweat build up. Keep the bodypack with the connector pointed down, so sweat drips away from the connector. The WA620 arm pouch is especially effective as it can help collect extra cable slack and keep the pack away from more sweat prone areas of the body. (lower back/waistline).For more humid environments (hot yoga, spin classes, etc.) or for instructors who are prone to sweat more heavily, we recommend wrapping the pack in a light cling wrap, latex glove or non-lubricated condom first, then inserting the wrapped pack into the waist or arm pouches mentioned in step 2.No Shure models are guaranteed against sweat damage. Wipe off, with a clean towel, all wireless equipment after a class. Never store the equipment wet - corrosion will quickly occur, particularly if placed into a sealed bag or case.Here are more hints:Basic Wireless System Setup and Operation ChecklistBefore any concert or event, professional sound engineers do a \"sound check\" to make sure their equipment is working properly. Wireless microphone systems are much more complicated to setup and trouble shoot than regular hard wired microphones. So if you have not used your wireless microphone system for a while or it is a new setup, test the whole audio system before your event.Setting up:Check your equipmentMake sure there are not broken or missing piecesMake sure all cables and connectors are in good condition, no nicks or cuts on the insulation.Make sure you have new batteries.Use the proper cables and connectors to attach the output of the receiver to the input of the mixer or amplifier.Cables with 1/4\" phone plugs or RCA plugs on the ends should be kept under 10 feet in length.Cables with 3 pin \"XLR\" connectors on the ends can be several hundred feet in length.Make sure the output of the receiver is connected to the proper input of the mixer or amplifier.Follow the directions in your wireless systems User's Guide.Microphone level outputs must go into microphone level inputsAux/Line level outputs must go into aux or line level inputs.Locate receiver and its antennas away from any potential sources of interference, such as:Digital equipment: CD players, MP3 players, digital signal processors, computers, digital electronic musical instruments and computer driven equipment.AC power equipment: Lighting dimmers and some neon or fluorescent light ballast.Maintain line-of-sight between microphone/transmitter and receiver.The microphone user should be able to see the antennas.Avoid metal objects, walls, and large numbers of people between the microphone/transmitter and receiver. Ideally, the receiving antennas should be in the same room as the transmitters and elevated above the audience or other obstructions.Keep antennas from different receivers at least 3 feet apart.If the receiver antenna is positioned vertically, make sure the antenna on the microphone/transmitter antenna is positioned vertically.The body pack antenna should be vertical.The handheld microphones' position is going to be variable, so the receiver antennas may be angled up to 45 degrees from vertical.Keep the distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver as short as practical.Minimum distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver distance is 10 feet.Maximum distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver distance depends on the environment in which the system is used. Outdoors, the system may work up to 1,000 feet while indoors, it may be only 50 feet.System Checkout and Operation:Use Only Fresh BatteriesTurn on the wireless receiver. Turn on the microphone/transmitter. Turn on the amplifier last.Stand in one place, talk into the microphone, and listen to see if the audio level is adequate.Do a \"walk-around\" test to verify no drop outs or interference.Tear down:Power down all your equipment. Turn the amplifier off first. Then turn off the rest of the equipment.Disconnect the cables. Coil them up and tie them off with a twist tie to keep them from tangling. This prolongs the life of the cables.If you have used the body pack and headset microphone for an aerobics application, dry it off with a towel. Unplug the microphone cable and dry off the connector.Keeping the cable connections clean and dry will prevent corrosion.  Don't crumple up the body pack antenna in your pocket or aerobics pack. Extend the antenna all the way. If necessary, hide it under clothing. If the antenna is crumpled up, you will get intermittent sound at best, no sound at worst.The receiver antennas must remain attached to the receiver when it is in use.Have extra cables, and microphones, and body packs available in case of loss or damage, especially if used for aerobics. Professional sound engineers realize that cables and microphones do go bad. They always carry extras so that the show can go on.Properly maintaining your audio system, cables, and microphones extends the life of the equipment. Taking a few moments to clean and pack up your equipment correctly can save you from nasty surprises later on."}

{"prompt":"What is the use case for EXT_SWITCH_OUT_STATE vs MUTE_BUTTON_STATUS?","completion":"The MXA310 and MXAMUTE button use the command strings MUTE_BUTTON_STATUS and EXT_SWITCH_OUT_STATE to tell when the device is pressed or when the device is muted/unmuted. There may be some confusion when deciding on the best command to use in certain scenarios.MUTE_BUTTON_STATUS reports ON when the user touches the hardware button, and OFF when the user releases the hardware button.EXT_SWITCH_OUT_STATE reports the mute state that the mic is requesting (ON=unmuted, OFF=muted).The switch out state event will generally come at the same time as the mute button status event, but the switch out value will be determined by the mute mode as well (toggle / push to talk / push to mute). Generally speaking:If you need to know whether the user is pressing the button and don’t care about mute state, you would use MUTE_BUTTON_STATUSIf you need to know whether the mic wants to be muted or unmuted, you would use EXT_SWITCH_OUT_STATEMXA310 Command StringsMXAMUTE Command Strings"}

MV5 can be connected to iOS devices, Android devices and Windows PCs and MacBooks and is Made-for-iOS and therefore must meet Apple specifications. MV5C however, will not work with Lightning iOS devices.When connecting to a compatible device the MV5 will automatically become available as an active audio device (input and output), whereas the MV5C automatically take over as the active audio input and uses PC speakers as a default.The audio output will remain the computer speakers or headphone output. Both microphones feature a flat preset mode suitable for any application.MV5 features a voice preset for voice recording or speech and an instrument preset for music applications. MV5C comes with a speech tailored preset called \"speech mode\", dedicated to home office and conferencing applications.So if users want a plug-and-play, easy-to-use microphone for home office use with their computer they should go with the MV5C. If they are slightly more technical and looking for a solution to record on the go, whether using a mobile device or set up at home, the MV5 offers greater flexibility."}
{"prompt":"I need a stationary wireless system. That is, I want the receiver and transmitter to both be rack mounted and AC powered. What can I use?","completion":"WIRELESS POINT-TO-POINT AUDIO USING AN SLX4 RECEIVER (Discontinued)Certain sound system applications require sending audio from a central location to one or more remote locations without using cable. Various combinations of wireless microphone and personal monitor systems can be configured to send audio via a radio link to meet this need. This FAQ discusses implementation of a wireless audio link using the Shure P9T transmitter and an SLX4 receiver (Discontinued).Both the P9T transmitter and SLX4 receiver products can be rack mounted, and they both can be AC powered. This is especially useful for permanent or semi-permanent installations, where AC power is available. It also eliminates the need to replace batteries. The P9T and SLX4 are both tunable in 25 kHz steps throughout their operating frequency ranges, providing excellent flexibility in frequency selection.Here are the implementation steps:Step 1 - Frequency SelectionIdentify available frequency spectrum in the area where the system will be used. The P9T and SLX4 can operate in the following UHF TV Broadcast frequency ranges:470 - 542 MHz, TV channels 14 - 25Procedure:Using various resources, such as the FCC TV broadcast database, RF spectrum scanning equipment (if available), and the Shure online Frequency Finder tool, identify vacant TV channels in the above listed ranges. Be sure to identify any nearby low-power TV stations and any proposed new TV stations which may cause interference both now and later.Identify any TV channels that are reserved for Public Safety communications in the area of operation. Wireless audio operation is prohibited in these reserved channels. When using frequencies in the G4, G5, G6 and G7 bands, it is imperative to avoid local public safety frequencies. See Public Safety FAQ.Once vacant TV channels are identified, select a candidate equipment and frequency band combination:TV ChannelsFrequency Range (MHz)Transmitter BandReceiver Band14 - 17470 - 494P9T-G6SLX4-G418 - 19494 - 506P9T-G6SLX4-G520 - 21506 - 518P9T-G7SLX4-G522 - 25518 - 542P9T-G7SLX4-H5  The best combinations will include more vacant TV channels. In some areas, more than one equipment and frequency combination may be equally desirable.If no other UHF wireless audio equipment is to be used at the location, use the SLX system frequency table in the product User Guide to select a frequency in a vacant TV channel. Make a note of the selected frequency band (G4, G5, or H5), the group/channel number, and the numerical frequency in MHz - this information will be used to program the equipment in a later step.If other wireless microphones, personal monitors, and intercom equipment will be used at the same venue, an inventory of all equipment and frequencies of the wireless equipment is required. It will be necessary to use a software program, such as the Shure Wireless Workbench, to synthesize and coordinate a set of compatible operating frequencies.Step 2 - Modify the SLX4 Receiver to Defeat the Tone Key Squelch Circuit.The tone key squelch function of the P9T transmitters and SLX4 receivers are different. A minor modification to the SLX4 receiver is required to defeat the tone-key squelch circuit for compatibility.Remove the 4 screws on the sides of the SLX4 chassis as shown.Press down on the front center of the top cover of the receiver so that the flange lock releases from the front panel. This allows the cover to slide backward as shown.Locate jumper R280 on the printed circuit board. R280 is located on the left side of the board.Place a solder jumper across the two points marked as R280 as shown.This could be labeled as R280 or D278, depending on the vintage of the circuit board.Reassemble the SLX4 receiver by sliding the cover back over the chassis and fastening the screws on the sides of the receiver.Step 3 - Program SLX4 ReceiverThe selected frequency group and channel from Step 1 will be used to program the SLX4 Receiver.Power up the receiver and attach a pair of antennas.Press the MENU button twice.\"Group Select\" should be displayed in the window.Press the SELECT button to advance the group digit to the desired value.Press MENU once.\"Manual Channel Select\" will be displayed in the window.Press the SELECT button to advance the channel digit to the desired value.After setting the group and channel digits, the programming mode will time-out after several seconds and the group and channel values will be saved.Step 4 - Program the P9T TransmitterAttach an antenna to the P9T transmitter.Verify that the RF switch is in the OFF position, and power on the P9T.On the P9T, press ENTER.Use the P9T Menu knob to highlight and select RADIO.Push the Menu knob to highlight the first three digits of the frequency.Turn the Menu knob to scroll through the numbers to match the first three digits of the selected frequency.Press the Menu knob again to highlight the next three digits of the frequency.Turn the Menu knob to scroll through the numbers to match the second three digits from the selected frequency.Press the flashing ENTER button to set the frequency. At this step, the P9T frequency must match the selected frequency which is already programmed into the SLX4 frequency.To enter \"Point-to-Point\" mode (PTP) on the P9T, press ENTER.Use the Menu knob to highlight and select AUDIO.Within the AUDIO menu, highlight MODE (MONO or STEREO/MX). Then consecutively press the SYNC - EXIT - SYNC buttons within a 2.5 second window.The P9T display will say \"ENTER PTP MODE? IT WORKS WITH UHFR RX ONLY!!!\" (Note - the PTP mode setting is compatible with a modified SLX4 receiver.)Turn the Menu knob to select YES.Press the flashing ENTER button.The P9T is now in PTP mode.PTP will be highlighted in the lower right corner of the display.Push the P9T RF switch to the ON position. The blue antenna LED should illuminate.Step 5 - Verify Point-to-Point OperationAny line level audio signal input to the P9T should now be present at the outputs of the SLX4 receiver.The green \"Ready\" LED on the front panel of the SLX receiver will indicate that the RF signal is being received.With this arrangement, a monaural audio signal can be transmitted from point-to-point via two AC powered, rack mounted devices.Operational NotesThe audio output of the SLX4 receiver is mic level and not line level.If line level is required, the SLX4 receiver must feed a mic-to-line preamp.When the P9T is transmitting, the \"Ready\" light on the SLX4 Receiver front panel will illuminate.When sending a +4dBU line-level signal to the P9T, use the AUDIO menu to select LINE and use the UP/DOWN buttons to set level to -16 dB as shown on the display. While observing the audio meters on the P9T, adjust the UP/Down buttons for deflection in the green and occasionally into the yellow range.A stereo signal connected to the LEFT and RIGHT inputs of the P9T will be summed to mono and sent to the SLX4 Receiver. To transmit in stereo and receive in stereo, two P9T transmitters and two SLX4 receivers are required. Send the left channel through one P9T/SLX4, and the right channel through the other P9T/SLX4 - set to a different Channel within the same Group.Point-To-Point (PTP) mode will remain active even when the P9T is powered off and powered on. To exit PTP mode, push ENTER, use the Menu knob to select AUDIO, and then change PTP mode to either MONO or STEREO/MX.A directional antenna, like the PA805SWB, is recommended for the P9T transmitter and for the SLX4 receiver. Use of directional antennas may extend the operating distance to 500 feet (150 meters) and beyond, given optimum conditions and a clear line-of-sight between antennas.This set-up pertains only to frequencies available on U.S. versions of PSM900 (P9T) and SLX4 wireless systems.

{"prompt":"Can you tell me more about Dante and AES67 clocking?","completion":"What is clocking?Clocking is a critical part of all digital audio systems. A device's clock is the part that ensures that audio plays back in time and at the correct speed. Think of it as a metronome for the audio samples. When multiple digital audio devices are connected together, they all need to share a common reference to make sure that audio is captured and played back in sync. Dante achieves this using the Precision Time Protocol, which is also known as PTPv1 or IEEE1588-2002.How does clocking work in a Dante network?In a Dante network, one device is assigned the role of Primary Leader Clock, and the rest of the devices will synchronize their internal clock to the Primary Leader Clock. This device can either be elected automatically by way of the PTP protocol, or it can be manually selected by a user in Dante Controller.Unless a network has hundreds of devices, any Dante device can serve as the Primary Leader Clock without any performance penalty. It's best to select a stable device which is unlikely to be rebooted or turned off as the Primary Leader Clock to avoid audio glitches on the network if the Primary Leader Clock role is transferred to a new device.The Primary Leader Clock does not need to be synchronized to any particular real-world time source, such as GPS. All that matters is that the device can maintain precise time over long periods, like a good wristwatch does. This ensures that audio is always captured and played back accurately. All Dante devices have dedicated chips on board to handle this task.Each Unicast Dante Flow, or audio stream, consists of four channels of audio. Each UDP packet contains 32 samples of audio for each of the four channels (when there are fewer than four channels, the rest are sent as silence). Each Dante Transmitter embeds the \"current\" time (per the Primary Leader Clock) into each packet of audio it generates. This is the time that the particular packet of audio was captured. Each receiver guarantees a specific amount of latency (usually 1 millisecond), and so with an accurate clock and a packet timestamp, the receiver can play back audio from multiple sources exactly in sync. This buffer can be adjusted in Dante Controller for some devices.How does clocking work when using AES67 Flows?AES67 uses PTPv2 (IEEE1588-2008) as its clocking standard. PTPv2 can coexist on the same network with PTPv1. If you are using AES67 on your Shure devices, the device selected as the Dante Primary Leader Clock will try to become the AES67 (PVPv2, or v2) Primary Leader Clock as well. The only time this may not be the case is when a high-precision clock source is in use. In this case, the Dante Primary Leader Clock will synchronize to the high-precision clock. See the Advanced Clocking section below for more information on these cases.Dante Multicast Flows and AES67 Flows are assembled in the same way as Dante unicast flows, although the number of samples and channels per packet can vary.Clocking Problems and RemediesThe PTP clock protocol relies on Multicast IP traffic to communicate among devices on a Dante network. It also assumes that Ethernet switches will consistently pass the clock packets to their destination immediately upon receiving one. If clocking is not functioning correctly, Dante Controller may report that multiple devices are all attempting to act as the Primary Leader Clock or that the Primary Leader Clock is unknown, or devices may randomly mute and unmute. The most common cause of these issues is that devices can't see all of the traffic in the PTP multicast group (224.0.1.129). If you are experiencing any of these issues, first verify that the switches at your site are not on our list of disqualified network switches, and replace them if they are disqualified.Some common network types and clock problem remedies are listed below.Single Unmanaged Network SwitchEnsure the switch does not feature Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE, IEEE 802.3az, or Green Ethernet).Power cycle the switch.Update the firmware on all Shure equipment to the latest version.Try replacing the switch with a known good network switch.Single Managed Network SwitchPower cycle the switch.Verify that the switch settings are configured correctly (see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping). In particular, ensure IGMP Snooping is enabled and the querier is running. If video is present, verify QOS settings.Update the firmware on all Shure equipment to the latest version.Try replacing the switch with a known good network switch.Multiple Managed Network Switches, Connected TogetherVerify that the switch settings are configured correctly (see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping).Ensure that only one switch is running the IGMP querier.Verify that the non-querier switches recognize the port connected to the querier switch as a multicast router port.Break the network apart, and verify that each switch's mini-network behaves properly on its own.In some cases, it may be necessary to isolate Dante Clock traffic to a small network. This addresses how to do this: How do I isolate Dante traffic?Advanced Clocking InformationPTP In DepthPTP is a network protocol developed by the IEEE which allows devices on an IP network to synchronize to a single Leader clock. On a well-behaved network, PTP allows for sub-millisecond time agreement between devices. There are two versions of PTP commonly in use: PTPv1 (IEEE1588-2002) and PTPv2 (IEEE1588-2008). Both PTPv1 and PTPv2 coexist on the same network. In most cases, one device will act as a Boundary clock, and keep both protocols in lock-step.The AES67 network audio standard specifies PTPv2 (also known as IEEE1588-2008) as its clocking and synchronization protocol, while the Dante standard specifies PTPv1 as its clocking and synchronization protocol. Dante-based audio devices will use PTPv1 to synchronize with a Leader clock, even when operating in AES67 mode. If there is a higher prevision PTPv2 clock on a network, then one Dante device will synchronize to the higher-precision PTPv2 clock and act as a Boundary clock for PTPv1 devices.  Shure recommends allowing a single Shure device to act as the Leader clock for both PTPv1 and PTPv2 clients (if an MXWAPT is on the network, it must be the Primary Leader Clock).PTP uses Multicast network traffic to communicate on a network. UDP messages are sent to multicast group 224.0.1.129, which all devices on a network join in order to synchronize. The PTPv2 Primary Leader Clock sends out multiple Announce messages to let devices on the network know that the Primary Leader Clock is the clock to synchronize to. The PTPv1 Primary Leader Clock includes the Announce information in its regular Sync messages.In both PTPv1 and PTPv2, the Primary Leader Clock (or a Boundary clock, when multiple clocking domains are joined) sends out multiple Sync and Follow_Up messages per second, which propagate to all devices on the network segment. These messages are used to determine the time it takes for packets to make it from the clock to the device. Devices also periodically send Delay_Request messages, to the Primary Leader Clock, with replies with Delay_Response messages. These messages are used to determine the time it takes for packets to make it from the device back to the clock. Devices take the average of these, and use it to bring their own internal clock into alignment with the time sent by the Primary Leader Clock.Timing accuracy with PTP is directly related to the accuracy and stability of the Leader Clock. The Leader Clock is a device on a network which has been elected to this role through an election process defined in the PTP standard. The algorithm takes into account the device's reported stability and accuracy, and breaks ties based on the MAC address of the devices tied for eligibility. In some networks, such as in television facilities or cellular networks, a Leader Clock with GPS-synchronized time is necessary for equipment to function correctly. This is generally not required for Dante or AES67 networks in most situations. Devices which are not GPS-disciplined are generally referred to as Arbitrary Clocks, and all that is required is that the device can generate time that meet the specifications set forth in AES11.Clock ElectionThis flowchart explains how the Leader Clock is elected on a Dante network:"}
{"prompt":"How can I connect my MV7 to a DSLR or mirrorless digital camera?","completion":"There are two ways to connect an MV7 to a digital camera with a 3.5mm stereo mic input. Both methods have slightly different drawbacks.XLR to 3.5mm via Shure A96F CableWe recommend using the Shure A96F cable, which is designed to adapt balanced XLR microphones for use with cameras with external stereo microphone inputs. With the A96F, you can directly connect the XLR output of the MV7 to the camera without powering the MV7. However, the mic controls will not be active and no adjustments are possible. The signal is taken before it goes through the internal mic processor, so significant gain may be required to attain usable levels.3.5mm \"Aux\" CableThe 3.5mm headphone output on the MV7 can be used to send audio to the camera, as long as the MV7 is powered by a phone, tablet, or computer. An external USB battery will not work, unfortunately. The headphone output is a stereo output, and with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm TRS cable you should be able to get good levels. We recommend setting the camera's gain fairly low, and the headphone output fairly high, to reduce the amount of noise picked up by the unbalanced 3.5mm aux cable. The advantage to this technique is that you can take advantage of the onboard mic processing on the MV7. Note: we recommend disabling the bias voltage supplied by the camera (usually in the range of 2-5 Vdc) to avoid undesired noise in the recording. Always perform a test recording in advance to ensure you obtain acceptable audio quality.Other OptionsThere are also third-party camera interface devices which offer a wide variety of features, such as internal mixers. Beachtek is a manufacturer of such devices. Note: There are no \"Micro USB to 3.5mm\" cables which are compatible with MV7 or any other Shure products.For more general camera interface questions, please see How do I connect a professional microphone to a camcorder or DSLR?"}
{"prompt":"Is it possible to share a set of Microflex Wireless (MXW) transmitters between two or more rooms?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to share MXW transmitters between two or more MXWAPT units. Each room will need an MXWAPT with enough channels to support the total number of microphones you wish to use at once, as well as a charger with enough slots. When moving the microphones from room to room, you will need to dock the mics and press the link button until the charger indicates the mics have been relinked. Mics do not roam between MXWAPT units on their own.Example ConfigurationA convention center has three breakout rooms, each with two permanently assigned lapel microphones (MXW1), and six shared handheld microphones (MXW2/SM58) which are intended to be used in any room. Each of the three rooms is equipped with an MXWAPT8 and an MXWNCS8. The MXWNCS is on the same network as the MXWAPT. The handheld microphones may be distributed in any combination among the three rooms, and prior to the meeting, the technician places the mics into the MXWNCS8 and holds down the link button for six seconds. The Link LED shows solid green, and the handheld mics are now ready to use in this room.We highly recommended labeling each microphone to indicate which slot it should be linked to, which prevents another microphone from being unlinked. However, simply placing a microphone into the charger will not re-link it—the link button must be depressed for six seconds until you receive a green light.Please note that this procedure does not allow for \"roaming\", where the mic can be taken from room to room without relinking. The mic is tied to the access point to which it was last linked and cannot hand-off its signal to another MXWAPT.Be sure all equipment is running the latest firmware. Components on different firmware versions will not communicate.For more information on combine/divide rooms, please check out MXW and a room combining system."}

{"prompt":"My Shure device is emitting tons of network traffic--like a few Megabits per second worth! Why is it doing that and how do I stop it?","completion":"Shure network audio devices send audio data over the network to other devices which wish to receive the audio traffic. There are three different types of network traffic that the products can transmit: Dante Unicast, Dante Multicast, and AES67. All of these modes produce sustained traffic as long as the device is powered up--traffic levels do not vary based on the audio level or whether a conference room is on a call.Dante Unicast traffic is sent in flows containing four channels of audio--even when only one channel is present. At 48 kHz / 24 bit, each Unicast flow will be approximately 4.6 Mbps of sustained traffic. This traffic will not flood a network, as it is unicast UDP traffic.Dante Multicast traffic is sent in flows containing one or more channels of audio. Each channel of audio adds approximately 1.15 Mbps of traffic to the flow. For example, if you had a Dante Multicast flow containing eight channels of audio, the flow would have a sustained bit rate of approximately 9.2 Mbps. Note that in some situations, this traffic may flood a network. This can happen when no devices are listening to this device (that is, no devices have subscribed to this Multicast group) or if IGMP Snooping is disabled or configured incorrectly.AES67 traffic is sent in flows containing one to eight channels of audio. Each channel of audio adds approximately 1.15 Mbps of traffic to the flow. For example, if you had an AES67 flow containing eight channels of audio, the flow would have a sustained bit rate of approximately 9.2 Mbps. Note that in some situations, this traffic may flood a network. This can happen when no devices are listening to this device (that is, no devices have subscribed to this Multicast group) or if IGMP Snooping is disabled or configured incorrectly.If traffic is flooding your network, we recommend enabling IGMP Snooping and subscribing at least one device to the sender's audio stream. See Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 for details on switch configuration. Note: if you do not have more than one receiver for a device, and all of your equipment is Dante-enabled, then Dante Multicast or AES67 streams are not required. Use Dante Controller to delete the Multicast streams for your device."}

Your control system should initiate a TCP connection on port 2202 to the Shure Control IP address of the device you want to control. Make certain the device and the controller are in the same network subnet, or that a gateway is specified and routing exists between subnets (see IP Addresses and Subnet Masks for more details).Shure devices don't support sending command strings to an arbitrary destination--a control system must connect to the Shure device over TCP.Shure control strings are always on and can not be turned off or defeated on the Shure product.Ensure you have included the angle brackets at the beginning and end of the command. For example:< GET MODEL >Shure commands do not use line endings, such as CR or LF.You cannot customize the command strings the Shure products use. Each product has a fixed set of commands and responses, which can be found on our Documentation Finder. Your control system will need to generate and parse these commands.Shure devices will send certain REP commands to your control system automatically. For example, some products with mute capability will alert you when a user presses the mute button. You don't generally need to poll for these, and you should be prepared to parse strings which arrive without an initial query.Do not close and reopen the socket repeatedly. Simply open the socket and leave it open.Testing the ConnectionTo test the Shure product, you can use PuTTY or PacketSender to initiate a connection and manually send commands and observe the response. Make certain your computer and the Shure device are on the same network subnet, or that you can ping the Shure device from your computer. Also ensure your device is running the latest firmware.Here is an example. In PuTTY, enter the IP address of the Shure Product. Change the connection type to \"Raw\", and enter the correct Port number.Click OPEN.For example, with an SCM820, if you mute a channel in the GUI or on the front panel, the SCM820 will send REP command strings.You can also directly type commands, such as getting the channel name. It may be helpful to write the command in Notepad and paste it in.The SCM820 will respond with the channel name. "}

{"prompt":"What is the difference between Plug-In Power (Bias) and Phantom Power?","completion":"Phantom power is used with condenser microphones. It is called phantom power because there is no obvious external power supply for the condenser mic; the power supply is invisible and therefore a \"phantom.\" The mixer sends voltage up the same wires that the audio is traveling down. Thus, the microphone is receiving the power remotely from the mixer. Phantom power is used to power up the electronic preamp (also called an impedance converter) for professional condenser microphones.Phantom Power is 11 to 52 volts of DC power that rides on the same wires as the balanced audio signal.Plug in power is typically 5 volts of DC used to power up the JFET of inexpensive condenser microphones. The voltage can be on a separate conductor from the audio or ride on the same conductor as the audio.In some condenser microphones, Plug-In Power (Bias) must be supplied on the same conductor as the audio signal. Condenser elements with a built in JFET use this configuration and employ a single conductor, shielded cable. Other condenser microphones use separate conductors for bias and audio. Make sure to consult the manufacturers spec sheet to get the exact configuration!A dynamic microphone should not be connected to an input that uses the same conductor for audio and bias (such as some wireless transmitters). It this happens, the frequency response of the mic may change and the signal can become distorted. If a dynamic microphone must be connected to an input with combined audio and bias, a blocking capacitor must be used. The blocking capacitor is placed in series with the “hot” conductor of the microphone and will pass the audio that is present and block the bias voltage. The capacitor must have a high enough capacitance to pass the signal without degradation."}

Do not make changes to an Enterprise network or networks managed by others without proper authorization.If you have a Cisco SG350 Series Switch, D-Link DGS-1210, Cisco SG300 Series, or Cisco Meraki switch, please see our switch-specific FAQ's:Configuring a Netgear M4250 Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67Configuring SG350 Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67Configuring DGS-1210 Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67Configuring SG300 Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67Configuring Meraki Switches for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67Before You BeginEnsure that your network switch is not on the Shure or Audinate disqualified lists:Disqualified Network Switches for Shure Dante DevicesAudinate's ListUpdate your switch's firmware to the latest version available from the manufacturer.Ensure your network switch has Gigabit ports. While it is possible to use a Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) switch, we do not recommend it as additional configuration and care is required. Contact Shure Applications Engineering for assistance with a managed 100 Mbps switch.Decide how IP Addresses will be managed. It is fine to use DHCP (e.g., from a Crestron server), Static, or Self-Assigned addresses. If you are using Static IP Addresses, create a spreadsheet to keep track of each device's address. See Documenting Your Audio Network for recommendations. For more on IP Addressing, see IP Addresses and Subnet Masks.General Switch SetupConfigure the switch with an IP address in the same subnet as your Dante/AES67 devices. If the switch has multiple VLAN's configured, it will likely need multiple IP addresses. Ensure there is an IP address assigned to your A/V VLAN in the same subnet as your Dante/AES67 devices.Disable EEE/Energy Efficient Ethernet.Multicast SettingsEnable Bridge Multicast Filtering to ensure the switch is actually filtering multicast traffic (some manufacturers have different names for this).If there is a Forwarding Method setting, select IP Group Address.If there is no video equipment, set the switch to Forward Unregistered Multicast Traffic on all Shure, Dante, and AES67 ports (as opposed to filtering). This includes the port for your Dante Controller computer.If video equipment is present, you will need to Filter Unregistered Multicast Traffic. In this case, you may need to manually add the following multicast groups to the switch's Multicast Forwarding Database to ensure the traffic makes it to all devices:224.0.0.230224.0.0.231224.0.0.232224.0.0.233224.0.0.251224.0.1.129Do not enable forwarding of ALL multicast traffic.

{"prompt":"What does \"noise floor\" mean in relation to a condenser microphone?","completion":"Background noise in a room consists of traffic sounds from outside, air movement from the heating/ventilation/air conditioning system, hum/buzz from lighting fixtures, et al.  These noise sources combine to create the \"noise floor\" of a room, i.e., the inherent background acoustic interference (noise) that must be overcome to perform a concert, have a conversation, to hold a meeting, or to place a phone call.A noisy ventilation system would be a major distraction during a classical music concert. But the same noisy ventilation system would not be noticed during a rock concert. The background noise (noise floor) in a room becomes less noticeable as the program audio in the room gets louder.A low noise floor is not required for a steel factory, or a bus terminal, or a rock club, but is necessary for a recording studio, or a hospital, or a library.  Providing a low noise floor is expensive as any recording studio owner will confirm.A condenser microphone also has a noise floor, often called \"self-noise.\"  The source of this inherent noise, or \"hiss,\" is the electronic circuitry within a condenser microphone.  Let's compare the self-noise of two Shure condenser microphones: the KSM44A and the Beta 98A.The KSM44A has an exceptionally low noise floor.  In the Cardioid setting, the noise floor is 4 dB SPL-A. This translates as: the self-noise (hiss level) of the KSM44A is the equivalent of a sound source that measures 4 dB in Sound Pressure Level, A-weighted. In other words, if the KSM44A were placed in a room where there was \"no sound,\" the hiss level from the mic would equal the level of a really, really quiet sound source emitting 4 dB of sound pressure level.In contrast, the Beta 98A has a higher noise floor of 30 dB SPL-A.  The hiss level of the Beta 98A would quite noticeable if compared to the hiss level of the KSM44A.  But can the higher noise level of the Beta 98A be a problem?   It would be if it were used to record quiet classical music or to record nature sounds in a forest.  But the Beta 98A was not developed for these uses; it was developed to mike drums and horns on a loud rock and roll stage.  In such a loud sound environment, the noise floor of the Beta 98A is not an issue - just like the noisy ventilation system was not a distraction during a rock concert. The performance advantage of the higher noise floor is a higher distortion point for the Beta 98A.  Give up noise floor on one end and the mic can handle higher sound pressure levels without distorting.  This is a good trade-off for a live sound microphone.So where is a microphone with low noise floor an absolute requirement?  One example is \"Foley Recording.\"  Employed in the motion picture industry, Foley is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to film in post-production to enhance the audio. These reproduced sounds can be anything from the swishing of clothing and footsteps to squeaky doors and breaking glass. Foley sound stages are exceptionally quiet and any microphone used must have a very low noise floor.  The KSM44A would qualify; the Beta 98A would not.Check the noise floor specifications on inexpensive condenser microphones.  Did you find one that is under 10 dB SPL-A?  No? Why? Because it is expensive to develop, design, and manufacture a condenser microphone with a very low noise floor.  Less costs more.  "}

{"prompt":"I'm creating a paging system and want to parallel wire multiple microphones into a single channel of my mixer. Is that ok?","completion":"Wiring Microphones in Parallel  In music, recording, or conferencing applications, it is not recommended to parallel microphones into a single mixer input.In paging applications, where the mics have mute switches and only a single mic is active at a time, connecting microphones in parallel allows more than one microphone to be connected to the same microphone input of a mixer. This reduces the cost and complexity of the paging system, since fewer mixers and microphone-to-mixer cables are required. There are tradeoffs, however:It is not possible to adjust the level of one individual microphone. Therefore, individual soft or loud talkers cannot be accommodated.Only dynamic microphones may be used. Condenser microphones requiring phantom power cannot be connected in parallel, because their cumulative current draw would exceed the capacity of most mixer inputs.In Push-to-Talk applications, the switches on the microphones must be of the Normally Open type. If any microphone uses a Normally Closed switch, it will short out all of the microphones that are connected together and none of the mics will operate.If two or more mics are activated at the same time, the output level of each mic will be less than if only one mic is activated.The connection from each microphone to the audio cable leading to the mixer should be made inside of a shielded enclosure to prevent pickup of hum and interference. Passive 2-into-1 microphone combiners can be used, and provide transformer isolation between microphones.The end of the cable that is farthest from the mixer input must be terminated with a resistor. The resistor produces no audio signal, but emulates the load presented by a microphone. This reduces pickup of hum and radio or electromagnetic interference when no mics are activated.Again, make certain the microphones to be used have Normally Open switches for the mic circuit; some models have Normally Closed but can be modified to be Normally Open."}

{"prompt":"How can I integrate the Microflex Ecosystem (MXA910, P300, ANIUSB) with Cisco WebEx?","completion":"On Oct 20, 2021, Shure and Cisco announced a partnership for WebEx and the Microflex Ecosystem.Where can I find instructions on how to setup Microflex Ecosystem solutions with Webex devices? Here you can find a comprehensive whitepaper co-authored by Shure and Cisco on how to setup Microflex Ecosystem solutions with select Webex devices. FAQ below are covered in more detail within. Which Webex products support two-way USB audio and mute sync?  Cisco Webex Codec Pro Cisco Webex Room Kit Pro Cisco Webex Room 70 G2 Cisco Webex Room 70 Panorama Cisco Webex Room Panorama Cisco Webex Codec Plus Cisco Webex Room Kit Plus Cisco Webex Room 55 Dual Cisco Webex Room 70 Cisco Webex Room Kit Cisco Webex Room 55Cisco Webex Room BarCisco Webex Room Kit MiniCisco Webex Room Board ProHow do I interface Microflex Ecosystem solutions with Webex devices? Using a single USB cable between ANIUSB-MATRIX Dante Interface or IntelliMix P300 Conferencing Processor and the Webex device grants the user bidirectional audio, mute and LED sync, and call status indication. Both audio input and output are required to support AEC referencing to Microflex Ecosystem products as well as microphone output to the Webex conferencing device. Which Shure products are compatible and supported alongside Webex devices?

No. IntelliMix Room software DSP is currently only supported on appropriate Windows10 devices. Which version of Webex  RoomOS software should I use?We recommend using RoomOS 11.0.1.7 or later to ensure systems function as expectedCan I set up Stem Ecosystem solutions with Webex devices? Yes. The latest RoomOS 11.0.1.7 supports USB two-way audio with Stem Wall, Stem Table, and Stem Hub.  Should I use Shure’s IntelliMix DSP or Webex audio DSP? It is generally recommended to use IntelliMix DSP onboard Microflex Advance microphones or Shure DSP/interfaces and turn off Webex audio DSP. More details can be found in the setup guide whitepaper. Can I use analog amplifiers or loudspeakers as part of a Microflex Ecosystem and Webex installation? When you require additional loudspeakers, it is recommended to use the MXN5 networked loudspeaker. If using the P300, you maintain the option to use Analog Output 2 as an output to an amplifier or powered loudspeaker, as well as using networked loudspeakers if desired. Can I use multiple Microflex Advance microphones with Webex devices? Yes! The MXA920, MXA910 and MXA710 array microphones include IntelliMix DSP on-board, so you can easily aggregate multiple microphones using the IntelliMix Out channel of the microphone routed to an open DSP channel on the IntelliMix P300 Conferencing Processor.  The MXA310 does not include IntelliMix DSP on-board, but you can still easily aggregate up to three MXA310s with a single P300. If you’re using just a single MXA920, MXA910 or MXA710 with a Webex Device – and don’t need the extra connectivity offered by the P300 – a single ANIUSB-MATRIX is all you need to act as the interface between the MXA microphone, the Webex Device, and networked loudspeakers in the meeting room. When using the ANIUSB-MATRIX, both analog audio connections will be used to connect to the Webex device, so only networked loudspeakers are appropriate. "}
{"prompt":"I have a design where I need to bring in a couple of analog (wired or wireless) microphones in addition to using MXA microphones all to a P300. How can I set this up?","completion":"If you have microphones that only have an analog output and you want to utilize the audio processing needed for proper conferencing, here's how you can make this work, especially if you also have additional (MXA) microphones as well contributing to the overall system.First, in Shure Designer, in the P300 configuration, you will want to take the analog input(s) and route this in the matrix mixer, to a dedicated Dante output(s). Next, route this Dante output(s) back in an unused Dante input(s) on the P300. This is essentially using the P300 as it's own A/D converter.Next, if these analog mics are to be reinforced in the room, you'll need to make sure that there are two different AEC ref signals established. One, a mix minus setup, where all inputs going to the loudspeakers with the exception of the analog inputs are routed to an additional unused Dante output. This Dante output is then selected as the AEC reference on the P300's AEC blocks. Then you will mult/take the output that is feeding the loudspeakers in the room (this is Dante output 1 by default on the P300), including the analog inputs and route this output into the AEC reference input in the MXA mic(s). Be sure to disable the AEC/NR/AGC block on the input channels on the P300 that the MXA mic(s) are going into.You can also reference the images below to cross reference how this should be configured:Dante routingP300 SchematicP300 Matrix Mixer settings "}
{"prompt":"Can you please provide guidance on how to properly update my ULX-D system to the latest firmware?","completion":"IMPORTANT: This document was updated in February, 2022 and supersedes all previous guidance. Please read this document before attempting to update firmware on ULX-D hardware.Firmware is embedded software in each component that controls functionality. Periodically, new versions of firmware are developed to incorporate additional features and enhancements. To take advantage of design improvements, new versions of the firmware can be uploaded and installed using the Shure Update Utility tool available on the Shure Update Utility page.When updating receiver firmware, update transmitters to the same firmware version to ensure consistent operation.The firmware of all ULX-D devices has the form of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.14). At a minimum, all ULX-D devices on the network (including transmitters), must have the same MAJOR and MINOR firmware version numbers (e.g., 1.2.x).The firmware update process is broken down into several steps. Depending on the status of the equipment, it may be necessary to execute only certain steps.IMPORTANT:  All receiver variants running firmware prior to 1.4.8 must be updated to 1.4.8 before updating to newer versions. Only ULXD4D and ULXD4Q receivers running firmware between 1.4.8 and 2.0.28 must be updated to 2.0.28 before updating to newer versions.Step 1: Connect to your receivers to your computer.Connect an Ethernet cable between your computer and the Primary network port on the receiver. If the receiver and computer are both set to Automatic (DHCP) mode, the devices will form a private network using link-local IP addresses in the 169.254.xxx.xxx range (subnet mask 255.255.0.0).More advanced customers with static IP addresses or a local area network should verify that the Shure Control IP address on the receiver(s) and the computer are in the same IP address range.Note: We do not recommend \"daisy-chaining\" receivers when performing firmware updates simultaneously, or updating over WiFi, as connectivity might be lost during the update process. Use a network switch or update one receiver at a time.If in doubt: just connect one receiver directly to your computer’s Ethernet port, and factory-reset the receiver to ensure it is in a known state.Step 2: Install the latest version of Shure Update Utility (SUU) on your computer.Download SUU from www.shure.com/firmware.Unzip the file, run the installer, and follow the installer’s on-screen instructions. If you had a previous version of SUU installed, the installer will automatically uninstall it and replace it with the newer version.Close and re-open SUU to ensure it is running as the local user and not Administrator (Windows Only).Click Check for Updates or ### Updates Available at the top of the window. Download all updates available. This may take a few minutes.Ensure your receivers appear under the Update DevicesIf they do not, see: Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't DisplayIf the devices all say Discovering, see: Shure Update Utility: Devices Appear as \"Discovering\"Step 3: Update ULXD4D Dual-Channel Receivers and ULXD4Q Quad-Channel ReceiversImportant: Read over this procedure BEFORE clicking Send Updates.Determine the current firmware version installed on your ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver.In SUU, click on the Update Devices Look at each receiver’s Current version column and make a note. Versions older than 2.0.28 require a special update procedure.You can also determine the firmware version from the front panel with the instructions at the end of this article.If the firmware version contains a star (e.g., 1.4.8*), or if you updated previously and the update failed, then follow the recovery procedure at the end of this document or contact Shure Applications Engineering.If the receiver firmware version is earlier than 1.4.8, follow these steps.Click on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver firmware for each receiver and select 1.4.8.Unselect the checkbox next to the transmitter firmware for each receiver. There is no need to update the transmitter file to 1.4.8 along the way.Click Send Updates. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware.If the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.If you just updated to 1.4.8, or if your receiver is on firmware between 1.4.8 and 2.0.28, follow these steps.Click on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver firmware for each receiver and select 2.0.28.Unselect the checkbox next to the transmitter firmware for each receiver. There is no need to update the transmitter file to 2.0.28 along the way.Click Send Updates. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware.If the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.If you just updated to 2.0.28, or if the receiver firmware version is on 2.0.28 or later, follow these steps.Click the check box adjacent to the receiver(s) to be updated. The Version to install will populate with the most recent firmware release you have downloaded.Click the check box adjacent to the Transmitter firmware for each of the receiver(s) to be updated. The Version to install will populate with the most recent firmware release you have downloaded.Click the Send Updates button. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware.If the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.Step 4: Update ULXD4 Single-Channel ReceiversULXD4 Single-Channel Receivers do not need to be stepped up to the most recent version. Simply follow these steps:Click the check boxes adjacent to the receiver(s) to be updated.Click the Send Updates button. Do not turn off the receiver until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware.If the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.Step 5: Update ULXD1 and ULXD2 transmitter firmware if it is running on an earlier version.Handheld and Bodypack transmitter firmware is loaded onto the receiver with SUU and sent to the transmitter from the receiver without a computer connection using the Infrared (IR) sync port. Follow these steps to update your ULXD1 and ULXD2 transmitters:Confirm that the associated ULX-D receiver is on the latest firmware version if you did not just update it.Locate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4” – 6” from the receiver’s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.Place the handheld or bodypack transmitter on the stand you found in Step 2 and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.Begin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.When the two devices are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.Press ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter. Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.If the update fails or if the ULXD1 or ULXD2 displays FPGA ERR! after installation, then repeat the update procedure ensuring the device is perfectly steady during the procedure. See ULX-D transmitter FPGA error for more information.Step 6: Update ULXD6 and ULXD8 transmitter firmware if it is running on an earlier version.If possible, we recommend updating ULXD6 and ULXD8 transmitters using an SBC250, SBC450, or SBC850 Network Charging Station if you have one, though update via the IR port is possible.To update a ULXD6 or ULXD8 via an SBC250, SBC450, or SBC850 Network Charging Station, follow these steps:Connect the SBC250, SCB450, or SBC850 to your computer or network.Ensure that the charger and all docked microphones appear in SUU.Click the check box adjacent to the charger(s) and microphone(s) to be updated.Click the Send Updates button. Do not turn off the chargers until the update is complete.If the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.To update a ULXD6 or ULXD8 via the IR port from a receiver, follow these steps:Confirm that the associated ULX-D receiver is on the latest firmware version if you did not just update it.Locate a music stand or other secure surface on which you can place the transmitter so it is 4” – 6” from the receiver’s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.Place the ULXD6 or ULXD8 on the surface you found, and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.Begin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.When the two are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.Press ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter. Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.If the update fails, then repeat the update procedure ensuring the device is perfectly steady during the procedure. If IR updates continue to fail, contact Shure Applications Engineering for further assistance.Recovery Procedures for Failed Receiver Updates:If a receiver on older firmware is not first updated to 1.4.8 (for units on 1.3.6 or earlier) and then to 2.0.28 (for units on firmware 1.4.8 up to 2.0.28), the SUU might tell you that the update has failed. If this happens, follow these steps to recover the unit:Determine which firmware the unit was running prior to updating. If you are unable to tell, contact Shure Applications Engineering to review the log files produced by SUU.If you don’t already have that version downloaded to your computer, download it for Dual-Channel or Quad-Channel receivers.In the SUU, click on the Firmware tab, and at the bottom, click Import. Select the firmware (*.pack) files and open them. SUU will import them.Click on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver line, and select the version the receiver started on.Unselect the checkbox next to the transmitter line for each receiver. There is no need to update the transmitter file during this procedure.Click Send Updates. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware.You may need to repeat this procedure two or three times until the update completes successfully.Proceed back to Step 3 above, and update the receiver to 1.4.8 (if older) and then 2.0.28 before proceeding to the most recent firmware.If you are unable to recover the receiver after trying these steps, contact Shure Applications Engineering.Additional Notes:You can download and install older versions of firmware from the firmware archive:Download the desired firmware version for your hardware:ULXD4 Single Channel ReceiverULXD4D Dual Channel ReceiverULXD4Q Quad Channel ReceiverIn the SUU, click on the Firmware tab, and at the bottom, click Import. Select the files and open them. SUU will import them.If you need to determine the firmware version via the device’s display, follow these steps:ULXD4, ULXD4D, and ULXD4Q Receivers: Press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to VERSION, and press ENTER. Firmware version is displayed. For example: 2.5.0.ULXD1 Beltpack Transmitters: Press ENTER, press the down arrow twice to select UTILITIES, press ENTER, press down arrow twice to select VERSION, press ENTER.  The firmware version is displayed.ULXD2 Handheld Transmitters: Use \"joy-stick\" key under battery cover sleeve.  Push key right once, push key down once to select UTILITIES, press key right once, push key down twice to select VERSION, press key right once to display version information.  The firmware version is displayed.Shure does not recommend downgrading firmware unless specifically instructed by Applications Engineering or this guide to recover from a failed update. Downgrades from 2.0.28 or later to earlier firmware can result in unpredictable results. Additionally, certain hardware versions cannot be downgraded to below firmware version 2.3.x. You can determine the hardware revision by navigating to the DEVICE UTILITIES on your receiver and looking for the Version section.  In there, you will see a HW entry.  If your receiver is Rev1 (or beyond), you will be unable to revert it to a firmware earlier than 2.3.x.  If it is Rev0, you may be able to revert it to earlier firmware versions."}
{"prompt":"What are the differences between the SLX and SLX-D wireless systems?","completion":"The SLX system used analog transmission and had a tuning bandwidth of 24 MHz and could support up to 3 compatible channels in 6 MHz of spectrum.  The SLX-D system offers many additional features and performance improvements, including:24-bit digital transmission with >118 dB of dynamic range for superior sound quality44 MHz tuning bandwidth and support for up to 10 compatible channels in 6 MHz of spectrumOptional Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery and dual charging dock for the transmittersAvailable SLXD4D dual-channel receiverReceiver Ethernet port which allows faster RF setup when using multiple units, as well as convenient firmware updating and control via third-party room control systems"}
{"prompt":"How does the SLX-D wireless system compare to the QLX-D system?","completion":"Both the SLX-D and QLX-D wireless systems offer digital transmission with exceptionally clear audio, low noise, and >118 dB dynamic range, so they sound virtually identical.  There are some feature and performance differences which are not significant to the houses of worship, schools, and small theaters that SLX-D is designed for.The QLX-D system offers wider tuning bandwidth (64 MHz vs 44 MHz), and can operate more systems in one 6 MHz TV channel (17 vs 10).  The QLX-D system is available in the UHF, VHF, 900 MHz, and (in some countries) the 1.5 GHz band; the SLX-D system is available in the UHF band only, which provides more than enough options for most users.The SLX-D system offers both the SLXD4 single-channel receiver and the SLXD4D dual-channel receiver; the QLXD4 receiver is a single-channel half-rack unit.The latency of the QLX-D system is 2.9 msec; SLX-D is 3.2 msec.The QLXD4 receiver is compatible with the ULXD6 boundary transmitter and ULXD8 gooseneck transmitter for use in meeting rooms.The QLX-D system offers encryption and network control via Ethernet, which the SLX-D system does not.QLX-D can be used with Wireless Workbench software and SystemOn software or the ShurePlus Channels app for remote monitoring and control. SLX-D can be used with Wireless Workbench softwar or the ShurePlus Channels app."}
{"prompt":"Is there any extra delay when using the Dante functionality of the Stem Ecosystem?","completion":"When using Dante with the Stem Ecosystem, one should note there is about a 250 millisecond delay from the time microphones pick up audio signals and the time the mixed version of audio is sent over the Dante network. "}
{"prompt":"How do I set up remote antennas for my Axient Digital, BLX4R, ULX, QLXD, ULXD or SLX-D wireless system?","completion":"Remote Antennas for UHF Wireless MicrophonesClick here for an online remote antenna tool.Antennas are described in terms of the signal wavelength they are designed to pick up. The antenna supplied with Shure QLX-D, ULX-D, and Axient Digital wireless systems is a \"1/2-wave\", meaning that it is about 1/2 of the length of the radio wave being received. The BLX4R, SLX-D and ULX Standard system comes with 1/4-wave antennas. A 1/4 wave antenna uses the receiver chassis as part of the antenna; therefore a 1/4 wave antenna must not be remote mounted.For good performance, the following guidelines should be observed when remote mounting antennas:Place antennas properly. Antennas should be mounted away from large metal objects or surfaces, which cause reflections that can reduce signal strength. Antennas should also be kept away from sources of RF energy, such as computers, digital devices, AC power equipment, etc. For best diversity performance, antennas should by placed from 1/2-wavelength to 1 full wavelength apart (1 to 2 feet for UHF). Wider separation between antennas does not offer significant benefit, except when mounting at opposite sides of a very large stage, for example. For diversity wireless systems, both antennas must be located in the performance area, and connected to the receiver via separate coaxial cables.Use the appropriate antenna cable. For proper performance, the impedance of the cable should match the impedance of the antenna input on the receiver (50 Ohms for Shure receivers). An impedance mismatch causes some of the signal to be reflected back into the cable, resulting in a reduction of signal level. Different types of cable are rated according to the amount of signal loss over a specified length (usually 100 feet). These ratings are specific to the frequency range of the signal being passed (VHF or UHF). The maximum length of cable is dictated by how much the antenna amplifier can boost the signal. See the section on antenna amplifiers. It is not necessary for both antennas on a diversity receiver to be connected to identical lengths of cable; ideally, each antenna should be connected to the minimum length of cable necessary to reach the receiver. The following table describes the maximum length of cable that should be used between a UHF antenna and a receiver input. If antenna boosters are used, the cable length can usually be longer depending on how much gain the booster provides. For example, using a booster that provides 10dB of gain, and following the cable loses specified on the table, you could run 108 ft. of RG8X/U. Note: the UA834 antenna amplifier can only be connected to the AD4D, AD4Q, UR4S, UR4D, ULXS4, ULXP4, ULXD4, ULXD4D, ULXD4Q, UA844 or UA845. The UA834 will not work connected directly to a BLX4R, QLXD4, SLXD4, or SLXD4D receiver.UHF Antenna Cable Loss Per 100 FeetCable Length from Antenna to Receiver Cable Type Signal Loss @ 800 MHz per 100 ft.Up to 25 feetRG-8X/U (Belden 9258, or similar)(Plenum: Times Microwave LMR-240-LLPL)~12 dB per 100 ft.Up to 40 feet RG-213/U (Belden 8367 or similar)or Times Microwave LMR-240 ~7 dB per 100 ft.Up to 75 feetRG-8/U (Belden 7810A or similar)(RG-8/U loss can vary manufacturer to manufacturer)~3.7 dB or more per 100 ft.Up to 300 feet Times Microwave LMR-400 or Belden 9913(Plenum, for permanent installation only:Belden 89913, Times Microwave LMT-400-LLPL) ~3.5 dB per 100 ft.Over 300 feet Commscope LDF4-50A(for permanent installation only! This cable is very stiff and requires jumpers at each end to connect to equipment.) ~1.7 dB per 100 ftMinimize the number of connection points. Each connection between two sections of cable results in some additional signal loss. Use one continuous length of cable to go from the antenna to the receiver. If antenna amplifiers are being used, mount the antenna directly on the input of the first amplifier, use one length of cable to go from the amplifier to a second antenna amplifier (if needed), and from the second antenna amplifier to the receiver. For very stiff cable (LMR-400 and thicker) it can be advantageous to terminate the cable in N-Female connectors, and use a small jumper cable that has an N-Male connector on one end to a BNC-Male on the other end.Use an antenna amplifier to compensate for cable losses. For long cable runs, an antenna amplifier such as the UA834 can be used at the antenna to boost signal level. Up to two UA834's may be used (one located at the antenna, and one in the middle of the cable run) permitting total cable runs of up to 500 feet when the appropriate type of coaxial cable is used. If a cable run longer than 500 feet is called for, it is better to locate the entire receiver closer to the performance area, and run a long audio cable to the mixing console. A long audio cable (balanced and line level) is much less likely to pick up interference than a long antenna cable. (Note: the BLX4R, QLXD4, and the SLXD4 receiver do not supply DC power to operate the UA834 or UA874.)No more than two UA834 antenna amplifiers can be used in one antenna line. This restriction is due to increasing noise due to the amount of gain being added to the signal, and to the limited amount of current that the receivers or antenna distribution amplifier can supply at their antenna inputs. This current is used to power the UA834, eliminating the need for a separate power supply. It is always preferable to use lower loss cables and fewer amplifiers than to try to compensate for higher loss cable."}
{"prompt":"Can I assign a fixed / static IP address to the Stem Wall, Stem Ceiling, or Stem Table?","completion":"Yes, you can assign a static IP to all Stem devices with the exception of the Stem Control. However, where possible, it is recommended to assign a MAC address reservation via the DHCP server to make sure that a unit will always be at the expected network address if you want your Stem devices to have specific IP addresses.You also have the option to let your Stem devices fall back to a link-local IP address (firmware 2.7.0.0 and higher). It should be noted that these specific IP addresses may change if the devices are rebooted."}
{"prompt":"Is there a default IP address for the Stem devices?","completion":"Stem Ecosystem introduced link-local IP addressing in firmware version 2.7.0.0 for all Stem devices except for the Stem Control. To allow your Stem devices to self-assign an IP address, first make sure all of your devices are up to date on the latest version of firmware. After updating, reboot all of your devices one more time. Upon rebooting, as long as the Stem devices to not detect a DHCP server on the local network, they will assign a link-local IP address.To discover which IP addresses your Stem devices have assigned themselves, you can attempt 3 different options:Open the Stem Upgrader 2.0 on a computer connected to the same local network as your Stem devices ,this will display discovered Stem devices and their respective IP address.IP scanning software.If you have either a Stem Table, or Stem Wall in your Room, you can press and hold both volume buttons, up and down simultaneously for about 6 seconds. The device will then read out it's own IP address to you."}
{"prompt":"What are some things to know when I update the firmware on my Stem ecosystem products?","completion":"Why is it important to update device firmware?Since we’re constantly working on improving our technology to make our customers’ lives easier, we push out regular firmware updates to provide you with access to the latest and greatest audio processing technologies, fixes, accessibility updates, and fresh new features. If you want to check out additional information on the latest firmware release notes, they can be found here!I just received my first Stem device, how do I access the latest update?First, use the provided Ethernet (CAT6) cable to connect your device to your network. Then, at midnight (local time), if the device is not in use, it will automatically check for the latest firmware version and update itself.Are there any specific internet network requirements needed to enable auto-updates?Specific needs may vary based on the configuration and permissions of your local internet network. We’ve put together some general recommendations below, but you can always contact your IT administrator for further assistance:PoE+ is required for all Stem devices.Stem devices will communicate with each other in real time via the network they are connected to by using an IP address assigned by DHCP. DHCP/Gateway access is recommended.If an enterprise DHCP server is not available, a simple (home) router is needed to successfully setup devices.When using an EEE (Energy Efficient Ethernet or ‘Green Ethernet’) switch:Smart Switch: Make sure that EEE is disabled on all ports used for real-time Stem traffic. Lack of power distribution will result in poor synchronization performance and occasional dropouts.Unmanaged Switch: Do not use Ethernet switches that don’t allow you to disable EEE function. How do I enroll in auto-updates?All devices are automatically set to check for the latest update (daily, at midnight, local time) if connected to the internet and if not in use. You don’t need to do anything else – we’ve got it all taken care of for you!Can I opt out of auto-updates?We highly recommend that you remain enrolled in auto-updates. However, if you would like to opt-out of automatic updates, you’ll first need to log into the IP address for your Stem device. Type the IP address of the device into your local web browser, then go to Settings > Device Firmware Updates > Enable Automatic Updates. Uncheck the box, then scroll up and click Apply Settings and you will be opted out of auto updates.Can I manually check for and trigger updates?There are two options for manually updating a Stem device:Option 1: Using a Web-BrowserFirst, identify the IP address for your Stem device.

{"prompt":"My MV7 doesn't produce that full, bass-y tone when I use it from a distance compared to when I use it up close. Why?","completion":"What you are describing is known as proximity effect. With any unidirectional microphone, speaking closer to the mic will result in more low-end. Speaking directly into the front of the mic will produce the deep sound that is typically associated with radio broadcasters. When using the mic at a distance, we recommend using the Auto Level feature in the Far Mode setting in the MOTIV Desktop app. To add some extra low-end, try using the Dark tone setting. Be sure that the mic is pointed directly at your mouth.The sound of your room will also have an effect on your mic's tone, especially when speaking at a distance. Adding more absorptive materials to the room may help.For more information, please see:Three Ways to Use Your Shure MV7 Podcast Microphone: https://youtu.be/gl7Ly4mwwVUWhy does Proximity Effect Occur?"}
{"prompt":"Why is my MV7's output level so low? ","completion":"It's normal for the MV7 to have a low output level. It's an insensitive microphone and is designed such. It is ideally used very close up - this is what gives it such great isolation and also gives it it's signature sound. Don't be afraid to get your mouth literally right up next to the windscreen, particularly if you're speaking in a medium to quiet voice. If you look at photos or videos of radio DJs using the SM7B, which the MV7 was modeled after, you will notice them speaking extremely close to the mic.The MV7 is a dynamic microphone, and dynamic mics typically have a lower output when compared to condenser microphones. Dynamic mics are passive, being driven only by the sound (literally moving air particles) around it. Plus, there's a relatively large mass in the mic to be moved by these sound waves. Condensers are active, and are electrically powered. They \"listen\" more attentively to the environment and have lighter moving parts. Condenser mics tend to pick up more of the surrounding environment, where dynamics won't, as they're less sensitive.If you find that the MV7 isn't working for your particular application, you may want to consider trying a condenser USB microphone like the MV5, MV5C, or MV51.For more information about these two types of microphones, please see Difference between a dynamic and condenser microphone."}
{"prompt":"What are the differences between the SE846 Gen 1 and Gen 2 models?","completion":"The SE846 Gen 1 earphones came with three sound signature filters: \"balanced\", \"warm\", and \"bright\". The Gen 2 version comes with a fourth, \"extended\" filter, which increases imaging clarity and adds an \"airy\" quality to the audio. The Gen 2 is also available in two new colors: jade and graphite. The drivers are the same."}
{"prompt":"I'm using an SM7B with a Cloudlifter in-line preamp and I'm not getting any signal. What's going on?","completion":"In-line preamps like the Cloudlifter, Triton Audio FetHead, and sE Electronics DM-1 or DM-2 require phantom power. Please check your mixer or interface for a button or switch labeled 48V and make sure it is engaged.For more, please see: What is Phantom Power?"}
{"prompt":"Will the MV88 mic still record sound if I'm shooting a video using the Camera app on iPhone or does it only record when you're using the MOTIV Video app?","completion":"The MV88 can be used with any app that allows external microphones. Set up the MV88 using the Shure MOTIV app. Then, go to the video app (such as the Apple Camera app) that you wish to use to record the video. The iPhone should use the MV88 for the video recording. If not, check your iPhone's settings to make sure the app has permission to use the microphone (Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone). When the light on the MV88 is on, the mic is being used for the recording.Please note that Shure has not tested the MV88 with the many third-party video recording apps available."}

Which Microflex Advance microphones are Teams Certified in conjunction with IntelliMix Room? MXA920 Ceiling Array MicrophoneMXA910 Ceiling Array Microphone Is IntelliMix Room pre-installed on the Teams Room? No. Users/integrators must always download, license, and install IntelliMix Room themselves. Can I buy an IntelliMix Room license from the Teams Room Provider? IntelliMix Room licenses are currently only available from Shure, through existing sales channels.What happens if I use IntelliMix Room with a Teams Room instance installed on something other than one of the Certified Teams Room hosts? Using IntelliMix Room on anything other than the devices listed does not constitute a Teams Certified system.

{"prompt":"I want to use the SM7B to record high quality audio into my computer. What is the best way to do that?","completion":"The SM7B is an analog microphone, and it does not communicate with your computer digitally. In fact, there are no active components inside the SM7B. Therefore, you will need an audio interface to use the SM7B with a computer, tablet, or phone.The Shure Motiv MVi audio interface is a great way to connect an SM7B to a Mac, PC, iOS Device, or Android device. The MVi features 56 dB of total gain with the 20 dB Boost enabled*, which is generally enough for all but the quietest SM7B users. If you require more gain than that, you may need an external phantom-powered pre-amp to put between the SM7B and the MVi, or a different audio interface altogether. Take a look at SM7B Output Level and Preamp Gain Specifications for some suggestions.*The 20 dB Boost on the MVi can only be enabled via the MOTIV Audio or MOTIV Video app on a mobile device. iPhone users will need an AMV-LTG micro-B to lightning cable.To get studio quality sound, be sure to mount the SM7B on a sturdy microphone stand or boom arm. See SM7B and MV7: How to Mount for some ideas. Use the mic in a room with lots of soft fabrics and cushions to reduce echo, and speak very close to the mic (your lips should be brushing the windscreen). One common trick is to run a long mic cable from a computer into a walk-in closet full of clothing, which will deaden the sound around you.Some users with older computers and no USB sound card may want to use the Shure A96F Camcorder Kit to connect the SM7B to the analog input of a PC. The sound quality will not be as good as with a digital interface like the MVi, but it may work for your applications. If your computer has a microphone input, you should be able to plug the A96F into it without any problem. The A96F will not supply enough additional gain for the line input of a computer. You would need to purchase a mic to line amplifier to use the line input (also called a preamp).For more information on transformers and their uses see Transformers - When to use and how does it work?Please note: When using the SM7B with a computer, look for and select your audio interface in your computer or device's Sound Settings or Control Panel. The SM7B will not appear in the list as it is analog. If you do not see your audio interface appear, contact the manufacturer of your audio interface for assistance."}

If you need a Micro-B to Lightning cable for your MVi, MV5, or MV51, purchase an AMV-LTG cable, which is 1 meter in length."}
{"prompt":"My MV7 is picking up background noise. Doesn't it have Voice Isolation Technology?","completion":"Voice Isolation Technology refers to the cardioid pickup pattern of the microphone, which picks up sounds best from the front and rejects sounds from the sides and rear. There is no digital background noise removal in the microphone or MOTIV Desktop app.The MV7, like any microphone, will \"hear\" whatever is in its pickup area. For best results, maximize the level of the intended source (your voice) in relation to unwanted sound (background noise) by speaking as close as possible to the microphone, and orient the microphone away from the unwanted noise.To learn more about cardioid and other polar patterns, please see our online publication, \"Microphone Techniques for Music -- Sound Reinforcement\".A properly sound-treated room will also go a long way toward minimizing background noise. Simply adding more absorptive materials, and removing reflective materials, will help.You can also consider using a noise gate in your DAW (for recording), or in a virtual audio mixing/routing software such as Voicemeeter (for streaming). A noise gate will keep your mic muted until the input level reaches a threshold that you set. This is very helpful for recording or streaming in noisy environments."}

A user may get longer (up to 10hrs) listening at less than Max Volume and/or without ENV mode. AptX at 100db SPL (Env mode Off) should get about 8 hours. Standby time is about 35 hours (powered on but not in use). How quickly can I recharge the Earphones? Fifteen minutes of charge will get you about 1 hour of use.  Two hours of charge gets you from 0% to 100% full battery.  How many charges are in the case? The included carrying case provides three additional charges for a total of up to 32 hours battery life.  If the battery is fully charged it will retain charge for up to a year.  How long does it take to recharge the case?  About two hours. Why does the TW2 case have a sticker that says “RMCE-TW1”? Does this mean I have an older generation? The second-generation versions of the Shure AONIC 215 True Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones (SE215-TW2) and True Wireless Secure Fit Adapter (RMCE-TW2) share the same regulatory name with their predecessors (RMCE-TW1). We are required to include the regulatory name on products, so you might see “RMCE-TW1” text included in certain areas of labelling on the new Gen 2 TW2 products. You can quickly determine which generation you have by looking at the date code printed on the interior of the adapters - located near the “L” and ”R” of the control button, just under the small Shure logo. The second-generation versions (TW2) include an underline on this date code, while the first generation (TW1) versions do not.  Additionally, you can confirm the generation by connecting your product to the ShurePlus PLAY app (available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores). We realize this can be confusing and appreciate your understanding of this regulatory requirement.  How can I tell if I have a first generation or second-generation version of the AONIC 215 True Wireless Earphones?   You can quickly determine which generation you have by looking at the date code printed on the interior of the adapters - located near the “L” and ”R” of the control button, just under the small Shure logo. The second-generation versions (TW2) include an underline on this date code, while the first generation (TW1) versions do not.  Additionally, you can confirm the generation by connecting your product to the ShurePlus PLAY app (available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores).  How do I know if my earphones are being charged?  How do I know the earphones are inserted properly in the case? Why does the LED inside the case not light up when I insert my earphones?  For proper charging, insert the earphones fully into the case until the top case LED turns solid Red. You can also see the LEDs illuminate through the LED side ports when it is unzippered.  What do the lights on the case mean?  Bottom:  The 3 white LEDs on the bottom of the case indicate how many charges are remaining in the case. Pushing the button will give you the case charge remaining status. The case LEDs will stay on if the case is plugged into a power supply. Top:  The Red/Green LED inside the top of the case will light up Red when a unit is placed in the case. It will stay Red if either module is charging. Once both modules are fully charged, it will turn Green for 5 minutes, and then turn off.  What do the adapter LEDs mean? Flashing Blue and Red = Pairing Mode Flashing Red = Low Battery 1s Single Blue Flash = Power On1s Single Red Flash = Power Off Solid Red LED when in case = Charging 1s Repeated Blue Flash = Link Loss (Primary adapter has lost contact with host) Solid Red during phone call = On A Call (configurable in PLAY app) How do I know which side is the Primary? (The Active Mic for Phone Calls) Although you hear call audio in both ears, only one side sends the audio from your end of a phone call. That side - known as the “Primary” - is identified in the ShurePlus PLAY App. To configure which side is the Primary, choose the side you prefer for phone calls, and power on/remove that side from the case first.    The first adapter that the phone/computer “sees” will become the Primary for that session only. That adapter will remain the Primary until any one of the following events occur: The unit is returned to the Charging Case.  The unit is powered OFF (via long-press of the adapter’s multi-function button). The unit goes out of RF range of the host (e.g., your phone or PC). The unit powers OFF automatically due to a Low Battery condition. When any of those events occur, the Secondary unit (if present) will take over from the Primary. The Mute tone (triple press during a phone call) will only be heard in the Primary. How do I clear the PDL (Paired Device List)?  You can clear from the PLAY app or put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. How do I peer pair a replacement adapter? The peer pairing process wirelessly pairs one adapter to another so that they work as a set. To pair your new adapter to your old adapter, put both adapters in the charging case and hold down the adapter buttons for 7 seconds, until the adapter LEDs begin flashing blue. To see the Adapter LEDs, look through the LED port on the side of the case. If I lose a unit and receive a replacement, how do I pair it to my other adapter?  To peer pair, put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. This also clears the PDL. Once you have peer-paired the modules to each other, be sure to use the PLAY app to update the firmware so that the new and old earbuds are both running on the same firmware. Why are my device settings “grayed out” in the PLAY app? Why can’t I change settings? If you are only using one earbud, you will not be able to change system settings like Pause Plus or Environment Mode. System changes are only allowed when both earbuds are “seen” by the host. Likewise, both earbuds must be on the same firmware version. If Right and Left are on different firmware versions, the PLAY app will disable any of the customization options. If I lose the charging case and buy a new one, do I need to pair it up with the original adapters?  No.  Why does it keep going into pairing mode?  If you continue to press on the Right adapter after you hear the “Power On” prompt, you will enter into Bluetooth Pairing Mode. It is important to release the button after you hear the “Power On” prompt unless you want to enter Bluetooth Pairing Mode.  What should I do if I’m having music playback issues through one of the earphones, or if I only hear \"Power On\" in one of the earphones?Try turning the units off and back on again. If that does not work, download the ShurePlus PLAY app (available on Shure.com, the Apple App store and Google Play store) and update the firmware to version 7.5 or later.  Why are my AONIC 215 earphones not loud enough? Download the 2.1 version of the ShurePlus PLAY app (available on Shure.com, the Apple App store and Google Play store) and update the firmware to version 7.5 or later.   There is a new feature that lets you select your earphone for the best listening experience. How many microphones are there in the True Wireless Secure Fit Adapter? There are two microphones on each module. On each there is one mic for Voice and one mic for Environment Mode. They work together in conjunction with DSP (“beamforming”) to improve voice intelligibility.  Can I use the Secure Fit Adapter with other MMCX earphones? Shure designed this system to work with its line of MMCX earphones. Compatibility with other earphones is not guaranteed; and performance is dependent on impedance and other characteristics of the earphones.What Bluetooth profiles are supported?  A2DP 1.3, AVRCP 1.6, GAVDP 1.3, HFP 1.7, HSP 1.2 Does this product support role swapping? Yes. Either Left or Right side can be the Primary (the Primary unit is the side that “talks” to the phone). When you remove them from the case, the first one the phone “sees” will become the Primary. It will remain the Primary until you put it back in the Charging Case, or it goes out of range, or the battery dies. If either event occurs, the Secondary will automatically take over and become the Primary.   Is there Multipoint Pairing? Multipoint pairing is not supported by True Wireless. How many devices can it store in memory?  Up to 8. The oldest will be overwritten by the newest.  How do I reset to factory defaults? You can reset by using the ShurePlus PLAY app. Tell me about Environment Mode Environment Mode allows you to hear the outside world with the touch of a button. If you cup your adapter in your hand while Environment Mode is On, the unit may produce feedback (howling). Sometimes this may cause the unit to shut down, but it will not damage the earphone. Setting Earphone Model in the App (“Earphones Connected”)  Select the correct model for best performance. Selecting an incorrect model may result in sub-optimal performance issues including insufficient output or overload shutdown.  What is Overload Shutdown?  An overload shutdown protects the battery circuit from damage. If you experience an overload shutdown it may be necessary to return the units to the charging case before they power on again.  What are the battery specifications?   Li-ion coin cell = 2.4g (85mAh, 4.2V at full charge) Is TW2 MS Teams Certified? No. TW2 is not UC or MS Teams certified.  "}

{"prompt":"I have an ADX2 transmitter. I'm just using a single mic, so I'm not using an AD610 access point and not using the interference avoidance features. When I put in a battery and turn it on, it displays \"Calc\" for longer than I've previously seen. It can take a minute before the run time appears. Is that to be expected?","completion":"When an ADX1 or ADX2 transmitter first powers on, it is performing several startup functions, including looking for a ShowLink access point (AXT610 or AD610). These startup functions cause varying current draw on the battery. When there is no ShowLink access point in the system, these functions can take longer to complete. The battery life algorithms in the transmitter can thus take longer to converge and display the estimated run time. In some instances, it could take several minutes for the algorithm to converge."}

{"prompt":"Why does one of my Aonic TW1 or TW2 True Wireless adapters lose charge faster than the other?","completion":"Whichever adapter is taken out of the charging case and makes a connection with your phone first will be designated as the 'primary' adapter. The primary adapter will use a bit more battery power than the secondary because the Bluetooth signal travels first to the primary, then to the secondary. The primary adapter will also be the unit which serves as the microphone for phone calls, which will further drain its battery. But, you should still expect around eight hours of run time from a full charge if using the AAC codec. AptX will drain the battery faster. Android devices will tend to drain the battery faster because they default to the highest quality audio codec available, while iOS uses the more efficient AAC codec. Android customers can select a different codec in Developer Options, if they choose to.If you are in the habit of removing one adapter from the charging case first, try switching to the other adapter occasionally so that you are not draining the battery on one adapter more frequently than the other. This may increase the overall life of the adapters."}

{"prompt":"My MXA310 and/or MXA-MUTE button are repeatedly muting and unmuting on their own. The problem goes away when I reboot until I touch the device to mute it again. How do I fix this?","completion":"This typically happens when a third-party control system begins \"chasing its tail\"--that is, it responds to the commands it sends, causing it to mute and unmute the mics endlessly.The recommended way to avoid this is to program your control system as follows:On the control system, watch for the < REP MUTE_BUTTON_STATUS ON > string. The MXA-MUTE sends out this command when the button is pushed.When that string is received, send a mute command to the DSP, to toggle the mute status.Wait for confirmation from the DSP that the mute status has been changed.Send < SET DEV_LED_IN_STATE OFF > or < SET DEV_LED_IN_STATE ON > command to the MXA-MUTE to change the LED color.Here is a screenshot of Crestron SIMPL Debugger:This should resolve the issue."}

{"prompt":"Should I match the impedance of my microphone to my mixer?","completion":"Impedance Matching for Microphones - Is It Necessary?What is impedance?Impedance is how much a device resists the flow of an AC signal, such as audio. Impedance is similar to resistance which is how much a device resists the flow of a DC signal. Both impedance and resistance are measured in ohms, the symbol for which is 'Ω'.What is the difference between low, medium, and high impedance?When referring to microphones, low impedance is less than 600Ω; medium impedance is 600Ω to 10,000Ω; high impedance is greater than 10,000Ω.For audio circuits, is it important to match impedance?Not any more. In the early part of the 20th century, it was important to match impedance. Bell Laboratories found that to achieve maximum power transfer in long distance telephone circuits, the impedances of different devices should be matched. Impedance matching reduced the number of vacuum tube amplifiers needed, which were expensive, bulky, and heat producing.In 1948, Bell Laboratories invented the transistor, a cheap, small, efficient amplifier. The transistor utilizes maximum voltage transfer more efficiently than maximum power transfer. For maximum voltage transfer, the destination device (called the \"load\") should have an impedance of at least ten times that of the sending device (called the \"source\"). This is known as BRIDGING. Bridging is the most common circuit configuration when connecting audio devices. With modern audio circuits, matching impedances can actually degrade audio performance.Are low impedance mixer inputs really low impedance?Audio mixers often have inputs labeled as \"low impedance\". Actually, these inputs have impedances between 1000Ω and 2000Ω in order to properly bridge the low impedance microphone. A low impedance microphone may always be connected to an input with a higher impedance. However, the microphone may not always be able to provide enough signal strength to properly drive the mixer's audio input. Always compare the microphone's output level (or sensitivity) to the required mixer input level.What happens when a high impedance microphone is connected to a low impedance input?When a microphone is connected to a mixer input with lower impedance, there will be some loss of the microphone signal. To determine the amount of signal loss (or \"load loss\") in dB, use the following equation:Rsource is the actual microphone impedance. Rload is the actual mixer input impedance.As a rule of thumb, a loss of 3.5 dB or less is acceptable"}

{"prompt":"How did Phantom Power get its name?","completion":"Because there are no additional wires to provide the phantom voltage. The same cable is used to carry the mic signal to the mixer, and to carry the phantom voltage from the mixer to the mic. One cable is used as a \"two-way street\". Early condenser mic designs used additional wires to deliver the operational power. Thus the method to deliver phantom voltage is unseen, i.e., a \"phantom\" method.Actually, the correct technical term is \"simplex power\"; phantom power is an early recording studio \"nickname\" for this type of voltage delivery system, and the nickname stuck."}
{"prompt":"What information can you provide about the 600 MHz incentive auction?","completion":"In the United States, wireless microphone and PSM systems which are capable of transmitting between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz are no longer legal to buy, use, or sell after July 13, 2020. To determine if your system is still legal to operate or sell, please consult What Wireless Frequency Bands are Legal to Use in the United States?BackgroundCongress directed the FCC in 2012 to reallocate some of the UHF TV Spectrum for use by broadband wireless devices, such as smart phones. Unlike the 700 MHz auction in 2008, the 600 MHz incentive auction offered broadcasters an opportunity to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds, hence the term “incentive auction.” This auction is sometimes referred to as the “600 MHz Auction” because the frequencies offered at auction started at 698 MHz (the former top-end of the UHF TV band) and moved down from there. The auction started in 2016. After four stages, supply met demand with a reallocation of 84 MHz of total spectrum (614-698 MHz, or TV channels 37 to 51). TV stations electing to continue operations were “re-packed” into channels below TV channel 37, making the UHF TV band smaller and much more crowded. The re-pack ended in July of 2020. More information from the FCC can be found on their website.  How did the Incentive Auction work?The Incentive Auction consisted of several sequential phases: the reverse auction, forward auction, and spectrum re-pack. In the reverse auction phase, broadcasters that had elected to participate submitted an exit price for relinquishing their spectrum assignment. The level of participation in this phase determined how much spectrum is available for auction and its corresponding valuation. These figures were also known as the clearing target and clearing cost. After the reverse auction, the buyers (such as, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile, etc.) bid on the available spectrum during the forward auction. If the dollar amount generated during the forward auction was less than that of the reverse auction, the process repeated. This sequence of reverse and forward auctions is known as a “stage.” After four stages that began March 2016 and ran through January 2017, the dollar amount generated in the forward auction exceeded that of the reverse auction.Since Stage 4 of the auction was successful, a new UHF band plan was issued and work began to repack the UHF TV spectrum. Once the band plan was made public, the clock started on a 39-month transition. During this time, broadcasters moved to their new TV channel assignments, and the auction winners began building out their new services. Once a new service commenced operation in a particular area, wireless microphones that operated in the spectrum between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz could no longer be used, making this a rolling transition on a city by city basis. The entire repacking process was completed on July 13, 2020, after which time no wireless microphones may legally operate in any of the auctioned spectrum, regardless of its level of occupancy.How will the Incentive Auction affect my wireless systems?You are no longer be allowed to operate wireless systems which can transmit between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz. See What Wireless Frequency Bands are Legal to Use in the United States? to determine if your equipment is affected.The FCC successfully auctioned 84 MHz of UHF spectrum. 70 MHz of this spectrum was reallocated to mobile broadband services. A 2 MHz band and an 11 MHz band will be used as a guard band and a duplex gap band. During the 39-month transition period, if you owned wireless microphone systems that operate in auctioned spectrum (616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz), it was your responsibility not to interfere with new services once they begin operation. At the conclusion of the transition period (July 13, 2020), operation of wireless microphones in the auction spectrum became illegal. Equipment owners are advised to confirm the operating frequency range of their systems and comply with the new rules of operation during and after the transition period. It is worth noting that 653 MHz through 663 MHz will still be available for wireless microphone operation, with some restrictions, during and after the transition period.

{"prompt":"I know that high SPL levels will cause distortion in a condensor microphone. But, will that high SPL level damage the condensor mic?","completion":"If the microphone is externally biased, and the diaphragm were to be displaced enough so that it was close enough to touch the backplate, AND there was not an insulating layer on the backplate, there would be a short circuit situation with a high voltage and thus a high current (spark) that would damage the diaphragm.In Shure's externally biased mics, such as the KSM44A, SM27, Beta 27, and KSM42, we laminate a layer of Teflon on to the backplate to act as a barrier to prevent metal-to-metal contact between the diaphragm and backplate. Thus, even if the diaphragm slammed against with backplate, there is no diaphragm damage. Without the Teflon layer, there is sparking and diaphragm burn spots.Actually, the diaphragm wouldn’t even need to touch the bare backplate. It would just need to get close enough so the external bias caused dielectric breakdown through the air-gap (like lightening). So if someone has an externally-biased mic with a bare metal backplate and the diaphragm gets displaced enough so that it either touches the metal backplate or comes closed enough for dielectric breakdown, there could be some damage and failure.  Especially if it happens a bunch of times. "}

{"prompt":"What happens if the MXCW system encounters interference during a meeting?","completion":"The MXCW system features Interference Detection and Avoidance, which works in a similar way to that found with Microflex Wireless or Axient Digital with Showlink. The MXCWAPT access point has a built-in RF scanner which continuously monitors the available frequency bands during the meeting. If interference is identified on the current channel that could impact performance, the system switches to a different channel that is known to be clear. This does not interrupt the meeting and does not require any intervention by the user or a technician.If you encounter interference that the Interference Detection and Avoidance algorithm is unable to cope with, here are some suggestions:Ensure your system is on the latest firmware version.Encourage users to keep phones and tablets away from the MXCW640 Wireless Discussion Units (WDUs). Don't place electronics on top of the WDU.Avoid lots of ad-hoc Wi-Fi devices, such as \"hot spots\" or \"jet packs\" which might take up Wi-Fi channels.Use a Wi-Fi Sniffer to scan the room in a couple of locations, and compare the results to those shown in the MXCWAPT configuration UI.If the MXCWAPT continuously jumps to a channel which then has dropouts, consider disabling this channel in the MXCWAPT configuration. NOTE: Do not disable all but one or two channels. The system requires a number of channels which are spaced out to operate correctly.Verify that the power level is set appropriately for your room. Maximum power is often not needed--less is more. See Wireless and RF Management in the User's Guide for more detailed guidance.Check the mounting location of the MXCWAPT and ensure it is located as far as practical from any Wi-Fi access points or other MXCWAPTs.Ensure the MXCWAPT is not buried within cabinets, ceilings, or other architectural features. The MXCWAPT should ideally be located in a place with line-of-sight to the WDUs, with the flat face of the MXCWAPT directed at the WDUs.Verify that the MXCWAPT is not mounted on or near large metallic objects, such as metal plates or grilles, or within a metal box."}
{"prompt":"I was giving a seminar on RF Tech a few weeks ago and discussing polarization loss. One of the attendees asked about the polarization of the UR2, ULXD, Axient handheld TX units and I was stumped. So, is the TX Polarization LHCP, RHCP, or both, on UR2, ULXD, Axient handheld units?","completion":"Unfortunately, there is probably not a clear answer to your question.  Wireless microphone transmitters use all sorts of schemes for antennas. In addition, the transmitters, and hence the antennas, are generally not stationary—they are constantly moving with a presenter or artist. Because of aesthetics, antennas are often compromised and shaped to be smaller than ideal, while still radiating a decent and usable signal.  For bodypack transmitters, it is fairly common to use a 1/4 wave whip antenna. The radiated signal can be generally characterized as linearly polarized in the plane of the antenna, which is often times, but not always vertical—depending on how the transmitter is worn or attached.Handheld microphones usually employ some sort of reduced size antenna. Because of this, the polarization is more or less linear, but the plane is essentially random and constantly changing with movement. The antennas can be considered radiating approximately an omnidirectional signal to accommodate motion.As a note, several common schemes for wireless handheld microphone antennas are:1/4 wave spike, often shortened by loading—not as common as in the past.1/4 wave element circularly wrapped—essentially a shortened or compact 1/4 wave antenna - used in several Shure products like the UR2 and ULXD2. Polarization is probably best described as random due to motion.RF coupled to batteries in handle to act as the antenna.  Polarization probably completely unpredictable and random.On top of these issues, body absorption is a major factor, especially effecting the signal from a belt work bodypack type transmitter. Handheld microphones tend to fare better in the body absorption realm, but can be compromised if a user/artist holds the microphone by portion of the handle where the antenna is located.To overcome polarization issues, diversity linear polarization type antennas, such as dipoles and log-periodic-directional antennas, are often mounted to be 90 degrees opposite each other (45 degrees off vertical in opposite directions). Sometimes circularly polarized helical antennas are used to help compensate for randomly polarized inbound signals. However, helical antennas tend to be very directional, and are often not a good choice for shorter transmission distances due to excessive gain.For link budget calculations, it is probably not too far off to assume the typical wireless microphone antenna's gain is somewhere between 0 to -3 dBd. Then be sure to add some margin into the link calculations - say 10 dB - to cover any path anomalies.Dr. Mark Kenkel of Shure, who was deeply involved with the design and development of the UR2 helical transmit antenna, adds the following:The helical in the UR-2 is considered a “normal mode helical antenna” so the maximum radiation is normal (90 degrees) to the axis of the helix. Small antennas like this are generally linearly polarized. Ours is also primarily linearly polarized. Circular polarization is possible with small antennas like this but only over a very small frequency range with the proper internal construction. The HA8089 helical is an “axial-mode helical antenna” so radiation is maximum along the axis of the helix. This type of antenna can easily be made to have circular polarization over a wide frequency range. Left- or right-hand polarization is determined by the direction of helical windings much like the threads of a screw. I believe the antenna is available in both left- and right-hand configurations. When using two HA8089 antennas in a point-to-point application it is important to use two of the same type: Left and Left, or Right and Right, pointed at each other. The HA8089 has about 7 dBi of directional gain. When used with a UR2, 3 dB will be lost due to polarization mismatch. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The HA8089 will provide about 4 dBi of gain independent of the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the UR2. When using two linearly-polarized antennas, a significant loss in signal can be obtained if the transmitter and receiver antennas are not oriented in the same direction (both vertical for example). To mitigate this we recommend that diversity antennas each be tilted 45 degrees away from each other. This also imparts about 3 dB of polarization mismatch loss, but will reduce the chances of signal loss from cross polarization."}

{"prompt":"Can you tell me how Microflex Wireless (MXW) compares to ULX-D and QLX-D systems?","completion":"Shure Microflex Wireless (MXW), ULX-D, and QLX-D wireless microphone systems both offer a robust feature set and can be used in a wide variety of applications. However, there are significant differences between the systems which often lead to one system being more suitable for a particular applications. In this article, we'll discuss some of the similarities and differences between ULX-D and MXW.Common FeaturesDante Audio: Both MXW and ULX-D offer Dante audio outputs. With ULX-D, you will need the ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver. All MXWAPT models feature Dante audio output. QLX-D does not offer Dante Output.Multiple Microphone Form Factors: MXW and ULX-D offer bodypack, handheld, boundary, and gooseneck transmitter options. QLX-D offers handheld and bodypack transmitters.Color Options: Both systems have both Black and White boundary and gooseneck mic base options.Rechargeable Batteries: All of these systems may be used with rechargeable batteries (standard on MXW, optional on ULX-D).Mic Elements: All of these systems work with a wide range of Shure microphone elements, including SM58 and Beta 58A handheld options, and most Shure lavalier and headset microphones.Remote Management: All of these systems can be managed remotely using the Microflex Wireless Software (MXW) or Wireless Workbench 6 (ULX-D and QLX-D).Logic Interface: All of these systems can provide a third-party control system with information via the Command Strings interface.Features Unique to ULX-D and QLX-DLatency and Frequency Response: ULX-D and QLX-D offer as low as 3ms end-to-end latency and full 20 Hz - 20 kHz audio frequency response. MXW offers latency as low as 20 ms latency and a tailored frequency response designed for audio conferencing applications.RF Frequency Bands: ULX-D and QLX-D offers systems which operate in a variety of frequency bands (region-dependent).Remote Antenna Inputs: ULX-D and QLX-D supports connecting custom-designed remote antenna systems consisting of multiple zones.Rack-mount Receiver Hardware: ULX-D and QLX-D receivers are rackmount, while the MXWAPT is designed to be mounted on a wall.Analog and Dante Audio Outputs: ULX-D offers both Analog and Dante audio outputs built-in, while MXW requires an optional MXWANI4 or MXWANI8 to provide analog audio outputs. QLX-D offers only analog outputs.Alkaline Batteries: QLX-D and ULX-D can be used with AA batteries or Shure rechargeable batteries. MXW has built-in rechargeable batteries.QLX-D and ULX-D Cross-Compatibility: ULX-D components are generally cross-compatible with QLX-D, and vice-versa. For details, please see: Will a QLX-D transmitter work with a ULX-D receiver and vice versa?Features Unique to Microflex WirelessAll-in-One PoE-powered Access Point: The MXWAPT can be mounted on the wall or ceiling of your space, and contains all of the receiver electronics. No rack-mount equipment or coaxial antenna cabling is required--just a standard Ethernet drop and a PoE-capable switch.License-Free 1.8/1.9 GHz DECT Band Operation: Microflex Wireless uses the license-free DECT bands to operate, which does not suffer from interference from local television stations or Wi-Fi.Customizable Button LEDs: The lights on the transmitters may be driven by an external control system. This is not possible with ULX-D since transmitters do not have bidirectional communication with the receiver.Unique Charger Design: The MXWNCS4 and MXWNCS8 may be used with any MXW transmitter. ULX-D handheld and bodypack transmitters use different chargers than ULX-D boundary and gooseneck transmitters.Cross-Product Compatibility: MXW components are not compatible with ULX-D or QLX-D components, and vice versa. For example, you cannot use a ULXD1 with an MXWAPT."}
{"prompt":"Can you please explain what QOS and DSCP mean? What DSCP values do Shure Dante-enabled devices use for audio and clock traffic?","completion":"QOS, or Quality of Service, is a feature of most managed network switches which allows you to prioritize some network traffic over other traffic. In Dante and AES67 networks, we use QOS to ensure that clock and audio traffic is treated deferentially compared to any other traffic on the network. Audio networks rely on packets arriving reliably, in order, and in at regular intervals. Enabling QOS on a switch ensures that this happens to the best of the network's ability.How QOS WorksOn a switch without QOS enabled, frames received by the switch from a source device get deposited into a receive queue to be processed. As the receive queue gets emptied by the switch frame-by-frame, the switch checks its MAC Address or IGMP Snooping table to find which device(s) the frame is intended for based on its destination address. The switch then takes the frame, places it into a transmit queue for the destination device(s), and one by one it forwards (sends) the frames to the destination device. These queues are required because only one frame can be sent or received at one time.On a switch with QOS enabled, the switch will prioritize traffic according to the rules you configure--that is, the switch will forward prioritized frames faster than other frames. It does this by setting up multiple transmit queues for each port. Higher priority traffic is placed into higher priority queues, and the higher priority queues are emptied (sent) before lower priority queues. Switches can use different algorithms to do this; we prefer Strict Priority, which ensures that high priority traffic is always sent as quickly as possible.DSCP ValuesThere are multiple ways to indicate which traffic should be prioritized, but audio over IP systems typically use the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) value in the IP packet header to set the priority level. Each source of traffic will include the correct priority level in this field, and we configure the switch to trust the incoming values are valid and accurate. We then map specific DSCP values to specific queues in the order we want. Most switches support either four or eight queues, and we place clock traffic into the highest queue, audio traffic into the second highest queue, video traffic into the third highest queue, and all other traffic into the lowest priority queue. This system only works in environments where we trust the sending equipment to set the correct values, and not just mark ALL of its traffic as highest priority.The DSCP values commonly used in audio networks are:DSCP56 (CS7)Dante clock trafficAES67 clock traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 3.xDSCP46 (EF, or Expedited Forwarding)Dante audio traffic (unicast and multicast)AES67 audio traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 3.xAES67 clock traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 4.x*AES67 clock traffic from most AES67 standard-compliant devices.DSCP34 (AF41)AES67 audio traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 4.x*AES67 audio traffic from most AES67 standard-compliant devices.* Shure firmware which adds DDM support contains Dante firmware 4.x and use these DSCP Values. Shure devices without DDM support use Dante firmware 3.x and use the Dante 3.x set of DSCP values.Audinate publishes their list of QOS parameters in their article How does Dante use DSCP / Diffserv priority values when configuring QoS."}

{"prompt":"I'm experiencing popping noises/plosives when talking into the MV7. How can I prevent them?","completion":"The p popping is called a \"plosive,\" which is the sound of a hard \"p\" sound hitting the mic's diaphragm on axis.   There are two solutions to eliminate, or at least minimize the plosive sound.  Option 1: Place the MV7 to the right or left of you keyboard or laptop, pointing the MV7 towards your mouth. Thus, the MV7 will be off to the side rather than directly in front of you.Talk straight towards your screen.  Plosive sounds move forward from your mouth rather than dispersing, reducing the blast of sound pressure against the diaphragm of the mic.

{"prompt":"I am trying to track down the model of microphones used during the 1970's for the Donny and Marie TV series. They look like they could be the Shure model SM61 but they are wireless and have an antenna like from a transistor radio pointed out the bottom. Are these a fake TV props? or are they real? ","completion":"You are correct. These were prop (fake) wireless mics. The mic was the Shure Model SM61. A small batch of SM61 was painted white, and called the SM61W. This model was never sold to the public. The TV show prop folk fastened an antenna into the mic’s XLR connector opening. The audio heard was : a) pre-recorded, or b) picked up by an overhead boom mic.The performers were used to holding a mic for live gigs, and wanted something to hold when on TV. At this time, wireless handheld mics were not reliable and very expensive, thus the fake wireless mic was conceived.This fake wireless idea was also used on other TV shows of the era: Sonny & Cher, Tony Orlando & Dawn, and American Bandstand."}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between the M75E Type 2 phono cartridge and the M91E cartridge?","completion":"There is no difference in performance.

{"prompt":"I am looking for a good vocal mic and I am a drummer. I am currently using a standard Shure SM58 which sounds good, but it picks up too much of the kit and surrounding stage sounds/noises.I have heard that the Shure Beta 87 Hypercardioid is a great mic, but I am wondering if it will isolate any better than a standard SM58.There are two versions of the Beta 87, which would work better for me?Also, the Beta 87 is a bit longer of a mic and this can be troublesome for drummers constantly trying to keep the mic out of the way of flailing drumsticks. I use a 90 degree plug on my mic cord to keep the mic as unobtrusive as possible. The Beta 56 would be the perfect size because it is the smallest, but it was designed for snare drums...would this mic work?Is it possible to have the Beta 87 capsule put into the Beta 56 casing? That would be ideal.Do you ever do custom jobs for the gigging musician?","completion":"The Beta 87A is a supercardioid, not a hypercardioid. If most of the leakage into the SM58 originates from the sides of the mic, the Beta 87A will likely work somewhat better.The Beta 87A which is a supercardioid.

{"prompt":"What are the fundamentals of microphone operation, that is, how it tranforms a sound wave into an electrical wave?","completion":"Editor's Note: I find that articles written at the dawn of a technology often have the most intelligible explanations.  Here is an exceptional 1938 article about microphone technology.\"Microphones Explained for Beginners\"Published August 1938 in \"Radio-Craft\" magazine[\"Radio-Craft\" was published from 1929 through 1953. Copyright is acknowledged.]The five most common types of microphones used for Public Address systems and broadcast radio studio work are: carbon, crystal, condenser, ribbon/velocity, and dynamic/moving coil. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages and we shall consider each type in the order named.Carbon button microphones were used in Alexander Graham Bell's first production model telephones. He bought the patent from inventor Emile Berliner because they were superior to Bell's own liquid element microphones.  A crystal microphones utilizes piezoelectric properties of a crystal for generating electrical signals.  A condenser microphone has a transducer element that includes an integral variable capacitor. A ribbon microphone is operationally simple and inherently bidirectional. A moving coil dynamic microphone is more rugged than other microphones types and not as prone to operational difficulty from weather.Carbon MicrophonesThe carbon microphone depends for its operation on the varying resistance of a carbon element when subjected to varying pressure. The usual arrangement of this type unit, for best fidelity, consists of two carbon buttons one on either side of the diaphragm. This metal diaphragm - in a properly-built carbon microphone - is stretched and air damped so that the effects of self-resonance vibrations are negligible, giving a reasonably uniform output at all ordinary audio frequencies.This unit has the disadvantage of a background noise called \"carbon hiss,\" which is caused by the passage of current through the granules. It has a high maintenance factor and must be handled with care. On the other hand it has the advantage of a very good power output level of -30 dB, together with low output impedance, making it possible to have the microphone some distance from the amplifier.        Crystal MicrophonesTwo types of crystal microphones are in common use today, to wit: 1) the sound-cell type in which the sound waves act directly upon the crystal; and 2) the diaphragm type which uses a diaphragm to which the crystal is attached by means of a mechanical link. In either of these units, the principle of operation depends upon the piezoelectric effect or voltage produced in certain crystals when subjected to mechanical stress, bending, stretching, etc.The sound-cell unit is an assembly of two \"bimorph\" Rochelle salt crystal elements in a Bakelite frame. The bimorph elements, in turn, are each made up of two crystal plates with electrodes attached, cemented together so that an applied sound will cause a bending of the assembly, and produce a voltage. The mounting is such that mechanical shocks have little effect on the unit.  No diaphragm is used as the sound impulses actuate the crystal elements directly. An exceptionally wide frequency range, even into the super-audible band and on down to zero frequency, may be obtained from this unit. Of the two types of crystal microphones, the sound-cell has the better frequency characteristics. Its output is very low, however, so it requires greater amplification. This type of crystal microphone is usually employed for full-range musical pick-up.  The diaphragm type will give much greater output, eliminating in most cases the need for a preamplifier, but it has the disadvantage of limited frequency response. This type of crystal microphone is most used for voice work. Condenser MicrophonesThe diaphragm of the condenser microphone constitutes one of the plates of a variable air condenser, while the back plate, which is separated from the diaphragm by a film of air about 1/1,000 inch thick, acts as the other plate. Capacity variations of this condenser, in series with coupling condenser, develop minute audio frequency voltages which are then amplified by a one- or two-stage \"head\" amplifier. In actual practice, the condenser and head amplifier (or preamplifier) are all housed in the same case and the whole unit is called a condenser microphone.After the signal leaves the head amplifier, it has about the same output level as that of a double-button carbon type. The same principle of stretching and damping the diaphragm is applied to the condenser type as is used in the carbon microphone, thus giving about the same fidelity of output. However, there is a noticeable absence of background hiss, and the ruggedness of the unit is a decided advantage.    Ribbon MicrophonesThe ribbon microphone is so named because the armature is a light corrugated ribbon of aluminum alloy. This type is also called a velocity microphone because the voltage induced in the ribbon is proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the air in the sound wave. The aluminum ribbon is suspended in the field of a permanent magnet and when sound waves strike the ribbon it vibrates, cutting the magnetic lines of force.Whenever a moving conductor cuts lines of magnetic force, a voltage is induced in the conductor. Thus in this case we will have set up in the ribbon a small voltage whenever it vibrates. Since the mass of the ribbon is extremely low, an excellent frequency response is obtained, extending well beyond the upper limits of the regular stretched-diaphragm-type microphone. This extended range of audio response is not very important as far as speech is concerned but does add brilliance to the reproduction of sound from musical instruments.The output of this unit is approximately the same as that of a condenser-type microphone, so it also requires a two-stage amplifier to bring the output level up to about -30 dB.The ribbon microphone is a low-impedance device, but it always has a coupling transformer mounted right in the microphone case. By matching the line impedance to that of this coupling transformer, the amplifier may be located some distance from the unit itself, provided the connecting cable is properly shielded.This type microphone is of a rugged nature and also possesses a very marked directional effect, the greatest response being obtained at right-angles to the plane of the ribbon. An \"acoustical labyrinth\" is sometimes provided to enhance the directional characteristic by absorbing 1/2 of the rear sound wave. The construction of the ribbon microphone is of such a nature that its operation is very quiet and free from noise or hiss.    Dynamic MicrophonesThe operation of the moving coil or dynamic microphone, like the dynamic loudspeaker, is fundamentally that of a conductor moving in a magnetic field, thus generating a voltage in the conductor. The diaphragm is made of thin duralumin which - in a high-grade unit - is pressed into a dome shape for stiffening to obtain a piston action over the audio frequency range. Improved frequency response is achieved by providing an \"air passage\" to afford outlet for the rear sound wave.The moving coil is made from thin aluminum ribbon cemented to the diaphragm, and moves in the air gap between the pole pieces. The permanent magnet is composed of cobalt alloy steel, which will remain magnetized for a long period of time.The moving coil microphone is quite rugged and is not affected by climatic conditions. Its output level is approximately 10 dB higher than that of the condenser-type microphone, or about -80 dB.The low impedance of the dynamic microphone makes it possible to locate the preamplifier some distance from the microphone itself. The frequency characteristic of the dynamic microphone is quite uniform from 35 to 10,000 cycles, so it has very good fidelity response to sound in the normal audio range. This type unit has no inherent noise, and due to its very rugged construction can stand quite a bit of rough handling.

{"prompt":"I was wondering how long Shure recommends the lifespan of the M44G stylus. Can I could get an approximation? I have been using my M44Gs for 7 months and they still work very well but I was told that replacing the stylus is a good idea to do before loss in sound quality is heard, as to not cause further record wear. What is the lifespan?","completion":"Typical diamond stylus life is 500 to 1,000 hours of playing time. The wear depends upon many factors including the tracking force, the anti-skate setting, the cleanliness of the record groove, etc. Using a specially designed microscope is the only scientific way to determine stylus wear.In your case, seven months is about 210 days. If you played records for 3 hours every day, the playing time would be 630 hours. In this case, a new stylus would be a good idea just to be safe.More info:Stylus Wear and Record WearPhono stylus inspection"}
